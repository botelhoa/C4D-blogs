As impatient as I am to start fundraising to build a lawsuit, these important steps involving kids and education require coalition-building to get off the ground, and that's gonna take a little more time.\\n \\nI did want to use this post today to update you on a matter extremely close to my heart--the Minocqua Brewing Company's ongoing struggle to build a beer garden next to our taproom in Minocqua, Wisconsin.\\n\\nI know this is a hyper-local issue that might not interest all of you, but I promise there’s a universal “moral to the story” at the end:)\\n \\nA month ago, I wrote on this very same platform that I would be giving up my fight with the Town of Minocqua to build a beer garden on my property, and instead build the parking lot they forced upon me. That 2-year-long fight was extremely frustrating and honestly made me a little crazy, like almost understanding the mindset of the dude who built the killdozer* (look it up). But most importantly, it took way too much of my time given that the tap room was a small part of our entire business.\\n \\nSince I wrote that I was waving the white flag, I went to a county zoning committee meeting where the zoning staff had created an analysis of all the parking exemptions that had been provided by the Town of Minocqua and the neighboring Town of Woodruff since 2020.  I included a picture of that analysis in this post, but here are the highlights:\\n\\nThe Town of Minocqua …\\n--Gave a total of 174 parking exemptions since 2020, but refused to give us 6.\\n--Gave a bar, a coffee shop, and a clothing boutique, all within 4 blocks of the Minocqua Brewing Company, full parking waivers (zero spots required) but forced us to install 6 parking spots.\\n \\nThe Town of Woodruff (directly north of Minocqua)…\\n--Gave Rocky Reef Brewery, the exact same type of business as ours, a full parking waiver (zero spots required) and waived 33 required spots for them, bringing the total parking waivers given by Minocqua and Woodruff over a 2.5 year period a WHOPPING 207!\\n\\nThat analysis was simply too much for me to accept, because it showed precisely how my business was being treated unfairly by the Town of Minocqua, who seemingly has no problem giving out parking waivers to most any business not named \"Minocqua Brewing Company.\"\\n \\nNow this is where the story gets a LOT BETTER.\\n \\nI went into that county zoning meeting (note it was the county not the town) hat in hand, not expecting much, but determined to control my temper and attempt to use reason instead of anger or ridicule to get through to these men (there are only men on the county zoning committee).\\n \\nAn lo and behold, it kind-of worked. They rejected my proposal on a technicality, but suggested that I go back to the drawing board and give them a new proposal that they could accept.\\n \\nThe technicality was that I had attempted to put the town’s required parking in an abandoned right-of-way (we call it the pork chop) that was technically owned by the town but an obvious compromise to build both parking AND a beer garden. The county, while they didn’t understand why the town wouldn’t agree to put parking in this obvious spot that wouldn’t be used for any other purpose, agreed they couldn’t force the town to put parking there if it didn’t want to.\\n \\nSo they told me to come back to them with a plan that didn’t involve the use of town property, so that's exactly what we're doing. Here is the first draft of our plan where we ask the COUNTY, not the TOWN, to give us a full parking waiver (zero public parking), just like they've given to four other businesses, including a brewery exactly like ours, within the last 2.5 years.\\n\\nI have a feeling that armed with the analysis that the Town of Minocqua provided 174 parking exemptions over the last two years but continues to arbitrarily force us to build 6, the Oneida County zoning committee, which has ultimate jurisdiction on parking because Minocqua is unincorporated and relies on the county for zoning and zoning enforcement, now fully understands that the town has purposefully tried to hurt us, and that its own “minimum parking requirements” are completely arbitrary and thus shouldn’t be enforced.\\n \\nSo what’s the moral of this story? \\n \\nFor me, it was a cliché that my mother told me long ago. “You can catch more flies with honey.” \\n \\nI feel, at least at the county level, that the men at that meeting, mostly conservative, softened when I used reason with them, and seemingly wanted to help solve a problem that was clearly ridiculous and eminently solvable. One even said, after excoriating me for my previous antics of raising hell on Facebook, “I can’t vote to deny a man a right to his own property.”\\n \\nThis meeting gave me hope—not just for Oneida County, but for Wisconsin and America. This is what government SHOULD be all about. Hashing it out in person, not on Facebook--being kind, considerate, and respectful--and figuring out how to treat everyone FAIRLY given the laws of the land.\\n \\nOh how Wisconsin and America would thrive if our elected officials simply did those few things and left their politics at the door.\\n \\nHow functional could Wisconsin be if Republican leader Robin Vos ignored the special interests that currently own him and his party, and instead sat down with Governor Evers to compromise?  \\n \\nHow functional could America be if Speaker Kevin McCarthy ignored Trump and his acolytes in the coo-coo caucus like Marjorie Taylor Greene, and simply hashed out compromises so America could move forward on the important stuff—like healthcare, education, infrastructure, etc. and STOPPED FOCUSING on the ridiculous stuff-- like banning books, arming teachers, cancelling Bud Light, and shaming trans athletes?\\n \\nObviously, these are questions that have remained unanswered since the beginnings of representative democracy, but I refuse to give up hope that seemingly intransigent men can be moved by kindness, sincerity, and logic…or at the very least be REMOVED by voters that realize that they're not representing their constituencies honestly.\\n \\nAnd with that, I wish you a happy and uncynical week. \\n \\nCome visit us at our Tap Room this Friday, May 12, for our summer grand opening. Then come back the following Friday, May 19th from 5-7pm, for the official release party of our new beer celebrating Wisconsin's new progressive Supreme Court: “Lady Justice, a Very Wise Weisse.”\\n \\nI'll be there in person, and we can raise a glass together to celebrate compromise, civil discourse, and a Wisconsin where at least 2 out of the 3 branches of government want what's best for its citizens.\\n \\nThanks for reading and sticking with us.\\n \\nKirk Bangstad\\nOwner, Minocqua Brewing Company\\nFounder, Minocqua Brewing Company Super Pac, Send your message right now: Tell your Members of Congress to protect trans people from discrimination.\\n\\nHelp us stop a new bill in Congress that would force a national ban on the health care transgender youth need.]</td>\n",

As impatient as I am to start fundraising to build a lawsuit, these important steps involving kids and education require coalition-building to get off the ground, and that's gonna take a little more time.\\n \\nI did want to use this post today to update you on a matter extremely close to my heart--the Minocqua Brewing Company's ongoing struggle to build a beer garden next to our taproom in Minocqua, Wisconsin.\\n\\nI know this is a hyper-local issue that might not interest all of you, but I promise there’s a universal “moral to the story” at the end:)\\n \\nA month ago, I wrote on this very same platform that I would be giving up my fight with the Town of Minocqua to build a beer garden on my property, and instead build the parking lot they forced upon me. That 2-year-long fight was extremely frustrating and honestly made me a little crazy, like almost understanding the mindset of the dude who built the killdozer* (look it up). But most importantly, it took way too much of my time given that the tap room was a small part of our entire business.\\n \\nSince I wrote that I was waving the white flag, I went to a county zoning committee meeting where the zoning staff had created an analysis of all the parking exemptions that had been provided by the Town of Minocqua and the neighboring Town of Woodruff since 2020.  I included a picture of that analysis in this post, but here are the highlights:\\n\\nThe Town of Minocqua …\\n--Gave a total of 174 parking exemptions since 2020, but refused to give us 6.\\n--Gave a bar, a coffee shop, and a clothing boutique, all within 4 blocks of the Minocqua Brewing Company, full parking waivers (zero spots required) but forced us to install 6 parking spots.\\n \\nThe Town of Woodruff (directly north of Minocqua)…\\n--Gave Rocky Reef Brewery, the exact same type of business as ours, a full parking waiver (zero spots required) and waived 33 required spots for them, bringing the total parking waivers given by Minocqua and Woodruff over a 2.5 year period a WHOPPING 207!\\n\\nThat analysis was simply too much for me to accept, because it showed precisely how my business was being treated unfairly by the Town of Minocqua, who seemingly has no problem giving out parking waivers to most any business not named \"Minocqua Brewing Company.\"\\n \\nNow this is where the story gets a LOT BETTER.\\n \\nI went into that county zoning meeting (note it was the county not the town) hat in hand, not expecting much, but determined to control my temper and attempt to use reason instead of anger or ridicule to get through to these men (there are only men on the county zoning committee).\\n \\nAn lo and behold, it kind-of worked. They rejected my proposal on a technicality, but suggested that I go back to the drawing board and give them a new proposal that they could accept.\\n \\nThe technicality was that I had attempted to put the town’s required parking in an abandoned right-of-way (we call it the pork chop) that was technically owned by the town but an obvious compromise to build both parking AND a beer garden. The county, while they didn’t understand why the town wouldn’t agree to put parking in this obvious spot that wouldn’t be used for any other purpose, agreed they couldn’t force the town to put parking there if it didn’t want to.\\n \\nSo they told me to come back to them with a plan that didn’t involve the use of town property, so that's exactly what we're doing. Here is the first draft of our plan where we ask the COUNTY, not the TOWN, to give us a full parking waiver (zero public parking), just like they've given to four other businesses, including a brewery exactly like ours, within the last 2.5 years.\\n\\nI have a feeling that armed with the analysis that the Town of Minocqua provided 174 parking exemptions over the last two years but continues to arbitrarily force us to build 6, the Oneida County zoning committee, which has ultimate jurisdiction on parking because Minocqua is unincorporated and relies on the county for zoning and zoning enforcement, now fully understands that the town has purposefully tried to hurt us, and that its own “minimum parking requirements” are completely arbitrary and thus shouldn’t be enforced.\\n \\nSo what’s the moral of this story? \\n \\nFor me, it was a cliché that my mother told me long ago. “You can catch more flies with honey.” \\n \\nI feel, at least at the county level, that the men at that meeting, mostly conservative, softened when I used reason with them, and seemingly wanted to help solve a problem that was clearly ridiculous and eminently solvable. One even said, after excoriating me for my previous antics of raising hell on Facebook, “I can’t vote to deny a man a right to his own property.”\\n \\nThis meeting gave me hope—not just for Oneida County, but for Wisconsin and America. This is what government SHOULD be all about. Hashing it out in person, not on Facebook--being kind, considerate, and respectful--and figuring out how to treat everyone FAIRLY given the laws of the land.\\n \\nOh how Wisconsin and America would thrive if our elected officials simply did those few things and left their politics at the door.\\n \\nHow functional could Wisconsin be if Republican leader Robin Vos ignored the special interests that currently own him and his party, and instead sat down with Governor Evers to compromise?  \\n \\nHow functional could America be if Speaker Kevin McCarthy ignored Trump and his acolytes in the coo-coo caucus like Marjorie Taylor Greene, and simply hashed out compromises so America could move forward on the important stuff—like healthcare, education, infrastructure, etc. and STOPPED FOCUSING on the ridiculous stuff-- like banning books, arming teachers, cancelling Bud Light, and shaming trans athletes?\\n \\nObviously, these are questions that have remained unanswered since the beginnings of representative democracy, but I refuse to give up hope that seemingly intransigent men can be moved by kindness, sincerity, and logic…or at the very least be REMOVED by voters that realize that they're not representing their constituencies honestly.\\n \\nAnd with that, I wish you a happy and uncynical week. \\n \\nCome visit us at our Tap Room this Friday, May 12, for our summer grand opening. Then come back the following Friday, May 19th from 5-7pm, for the official release party of our new beer celebrating Wisconsin's new progressive Supreme Court: “Lady Justice, a Very Wise Weisse.”\\n \\nI'll be there in person, and we can raise a glass together to celebrate compromise, civil discourse, and a Wisconsin where at least 2 out of the 3 branches of government want what's best for its citizens.\\n \\nThanks for reading and sticking with us.\\n \\nKirk Bangstad\\nOwner, Minocqua Brewing Company\\nFounder, Minocqua Brewing Company Super Pac, Send your message right now: Tell your Members of Congress to protect trans people from discrimination.\\n\\nHelp us stop a new bill in Congress that would force a national ban on the health care transgender youth need.]  \n",

[MAGA Republicans are escalating their vicious attacks against LGBTQ+ folks—especially trans and nonbinary kids—so it's important that we all vocally support the fight for equity and justice for all.\\n\\nThat's why MoveOn has printed a huge batch of these \"Pride Has a Story\" stickers—and is giving them away for FREE, while supplies last! MoveOn’s sticker, created by queer artist Agnes Barton-Sabo (aka Betty Turbo), pays homage to two revolutionary drag queens, trans activists, and trailblazers of color: Marsha P. Johnson and Sylvia Rivera.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1969, Johnson and Rivera led uprisings at the Stonewall Inn, an LGBTQ+ bar, after police raided the bar as part of an effort to shut down LGBTQ+-friendly establishments. On the one-year anniversary of the Stonewall uprisings, the first Pride parades in U.S. history took place across the country.\\n\\nToday, 54 years after the Stonewall uprisings, we commemorate the history of Pride, honor early LGBTQ+ leaders like Johnson and Rivera, and recommit ourselves to the fight for equity and justice.\\n\\nClick below to order your free \"Pride Has a Story\" sticker now and display it proudly to spark conversations about the history of the LGBTQ+ movement and inspire others to join the fight for freedom for all.\\n\\n[PAID FOR BY MOVEON.ORG POLITICAL ACTION,  Not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.], Community means different things to all of us. It can mean safety and acceptance; it can mean a group of people bonded together by a common belief; or it can mean your chosen family, the loved ones who along the way come into our lives and make our world a better place.\\n\\nHere at The Trevor Project, we believe that community means all of the above. We also believe that the power of community is life-changing to LGBTQ young people. Because when we come together — from young LGBTQ students who are marching to demand more rights and acceptance, to the grandparents who are learning more about how to support and affirm their trans grandchild — real change and progress happens.\\n\\nOne voice is loud, but a community of voices is going to change the world.

Johnson and Sylvia Rivera, fought back against police brutality and harassment of the queer community. Stonewall is remembered as the spark that started the LGBTQ+ rights movement across the globe.\\n\\nToday, 54 years after Stonewall and amid Republican efforts to terrorize trans youth and roll back so many years of progress, it's so important that we commemorate the history of Pride, honor early LGBTQ+ leaders like Johnson and Rivera, and recommit ourselves to the fight for equity and justice.\\n\\nThat's why MoveOn has partnered with queer artist Agnes Barton-Sabo (aka Betty Turbo) to design this commemorative \"Pride Has a Story\" sticker featuring Marsha P.

           [The extremist playbook is clear: Silence lawmakers they disagree with, however they can.\\n\\nIn Montana, the GOP state house silenced their colleague Rep. Zooey Zephyr — the first openly transgender woman elected to the Montana Legislature — who they did not let speak in debates for the last two weeks of session because she spoke out against a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors.\\n\\nIt’s the same sentiment we’ve seen in the Tennessee legislature after two Black members — Rep. Justin Jones and Rep. Justin Pearson — were expelled for protesting gun violence. It’s shameful and undemocratic. \\n\\nAdd your name today to denounce these anti-democratic attacks in state houses across the country., The first openly transgender Representative in the Montana House, Zooey Zephyr, has been subjected to shameless bullying and censoring by Montana Republicans. She’s being punished by the GOP for speaking out against anti-trans bills that they’ve been working to pass. Rep. Zephyr has been barred from speaking and engaging in the legislative session since the end of April, blocking her ability to represent her constituents. Add your name now to express solidarity and call on Montana’s anti-LGBTQ+ Republicans to #LetHerSpeak. (Paid for by MoveOn.org Political Action, pol.moveon.org, not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee.), Montana Republicans have censored and disciplined Representative Zooey Zephyr, blocking her from the chamber simply for speaking her mind as the first openly transgender woman to be elected to the Montana House of Representatives. Rep. Zephyr spoke passionately about the harm that anti-trans bills would cause in response to several attempts by the Montana GOP to pass dangerous, violent, and transphobic bills. Now they're trying to silence her to bar her from participating in the legislative session entirely. Sign the petition today to demand Montana Republicans allow Rep. Zephyr to represent the constituents who elected her and govern to the will of the people.

I have been reading you for years. You have great sources but also a great insight into what is happening in this corrupt world. I used to question your warnings that the United States would end up in a civil war. I’m at the point I cannot see how it is not possible. Are they really this stupid to go after Trump if he could still become president even if convicted? FS ANSWER: This is an absolutely desperate attempt to make sure Trump does not ever get back to the White House. Even if he does, the talk in DC is that they will use this conviction for impeachment. But that would not really pass the test since it would be before taking office unless they stretch it out until January after he is sworn in. Nevertheless, there is far too much on the line for the Neocons. They will assassinate him as a last resort. These people assume the public is stupid and it will all blow over in 30 days anyhow when football season begins. They really do believe like the Romans, give is sports and they can do as they like. If we look at the indictment, 31 of the 37 counts brought against Trump allege he willfully retained national defense information, which is a violation of the Espionage Act. This is really a stretch for the intent of that act was espionage and nobody is making a case that Trump was handing it to an enemy. Nevertheless, the indictment was extremely dangerous and far more serious than what Nixon faced. They are not playing games. They are desperately staging this to put him in prison. Still, there is no actual smoking gun as they say. Trump has spoken about the classified documents acknowledging that they were classified. This is a serious risk and only a jury with common sense would find him not guilty. They use conspiracy so they do not have to prove everything beyond a reasonable doubt. It will be a case arguing what they “think” was in his mind at the time. Even this is selective prosecution after Biden had classified documents thrown in his car. They are already trying to recuse the judge, They want a hanging judge and that is how the government works. When Judge McKenna was protecting me. they made a recusal motion. He denied it. So they went to the Chief Judge and had the case removed and sent to a hanging judge – John F. Kennan – a former prosecutor. Here is my docket sheet. How they remove Judge McKenna was sealed. I was NEVER allowed to see which is an outright violation of Due Process of Law. It does not matter. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals refused to ever address anything in my case whatsoever! I confront Judge Owen that he was altering the transcripts which is a felony. I forced him to admit it. Under the law, he should have recused himself for now he was a witness in my case. I tried to appeal that and the Second Circuit lost the appeal 3 times. Now you can see what Thomas Jefferson was writing about. There is no rule of law in the United States. If they want you, you have ZERO constitutional or human rights. They even tried to kill me in the same place they killed Jeffrey Epstein. I was in the hospital in a coma but to their dismay, I survived. Shakespeare’s famous line from Henry VI, “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers” must be put in its proper context. At that point in history, a charged persona had NO RIGHT to counsel. The ONLY lawyers were actually the king’s prosecutors. So you can see, even Shakespeare understood how the rule of law is a joke. Even Charles Dickens has written about how corrupt the legal system had become back in 1853. Dickens wrote in Chapter I, “In Chancery” of his celebrated Bleake House, “Suffer any wrong that can be done you, rather than come here!” Indeed, the current state of American federal courts has once again reached the lowest point completing the revolution of the wheel of political fortune. Perhaps this is in line with what we should expect as we move into 2032 where governments around the world will collapse from their own internal corruption. Trump should kiss the wife and kids goodbye, for he has little chance of defeating this corrupt system. As Herbert Hoover wrote: “Sometimes when a government; is enraged, it burns down the barn to get the rat.” This is how the law is just always abused. If a parent is against transgenderism, in California Newsome wants to charge them with child abuse. That would allow courts to take custody of children awake from the parent under old laws. If a child under 18 cannot have sex consensually, how can then change their sex? Good luck with ANY California judge ruling in your favor. Kiss your children goodbye as well if they are brainwashed into thinking they should change their sex even at age 7 to 12. A 17-year-old cannot consent to sex, but to vaccinate minors without parental consent was OK because a minor can consent to be vaccinated, but (truncated), Our American world grows more depressing by the week. If you don't believe me, just check out this Maggie Astor report in the New York Times. Tom \"There were more than 350 incidents of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment, vandalism or assault in the United States from June 2022 through April 2023, according to a new report, reflecting a climate in which bias against gay and especially transgender people has become widespread. The incidents, which were reported in 46 states and the District of Columbia, included online harassment, gatherings of armed protesters outside drag shows, and bomb threats against hospitals that provide gender transition care. They also included the mass shooting in November at an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in Colorado.\"  The report was produced by the Anti-Defamation League and the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group GLAAD, which collected data from news coverage as well as direct reports from victims. As with other attempts to quantify attacks on marginalized groups, the numbers in the report are certain to be undercounts, because many people don’t report their experiences. By far the most frequent targets noted in the report were drag shows and drag performers, who were the victims in 138 incidents. Other common targets were schools and educators, health care facilities and providers, and government buildings and officials. California, Florida, New York and Texas had the most incidents, but they are also the most populous states. The report uses similar methodology to what A.D.L. has long used to produce reports about incidents of antisemitism. It is the first time A.D.L. and GLAAD have compiled a report on homophobic and transphobic incidents. Sarah Moore, an analyst of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. extremism for both organizations, said they plan to release new editions annually from now on. “Hard data like this backs up what so many of us in the L.G.B.T.Q. community are unfortunately experiencing right now,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, the president of GLAAD. “That revolting anti-gay comment you saw on a neighbor’s social media page, that shocking disinformation about trans youth you heard at a school board meeting, and that attack by extremists at your local Drag Story Hour — these are not isolated events.” Because this is the first such report, it does not show how the prevalence of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment and violence has changed over time. But there are indications that they are increasing: As of Tuesday, A.D.L. and GLAAD had documented 101 such incidents in the first three weeks of June, which is Pride Month. That is more than twice the number the organizations counted from last June. An upcoming report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino shows a 52 percent increase in anti-L.G.B.T.Q. hate crimes around the country in 2022 and a 28 percent increase in the narrower anti-transgender category, according to the center’s director, Prof. Brian Levin. It also shows a 47 percent increase in hate crimes against gender-nonconforming people, which the report defines as including drag performers. That report looks only at incidents in major cities and focuses specifically on hate crimes. By contrast, not all of the incidents in the A.D.L. and GLAAD report would be classified as crimes. Nearly half of the incidents in the report from A.D.L. and GLAAD involved perpetrators associated with extremist groups, such as the Proud Boys or neo-Nazi organizations. And the report found significant overlap with other forms of bias: Of the 356 anti-L.G.B.T.Q. incidents it counted, antisemitism was also a factor in 128, and racism in 30. But Ms. Moore said it was also striking that half of the incidents were unconnected to extremist groups. That finding, she said, reflects the degree to which anti-L.G.B.T.Q. sentiment is “being mainstreamed in society and being picked up on by local church groups, local parents’ rights groups, whatever might be the local grass-roots movement for the Republican Party.” Historical data indicates that increases in hate crimes are closely related to increases in hateful rhetoric from politicians and other influential figures, Professor Levin said, adding that he was very concerned about the current trend. This year, Republican lawmakers have passed dozens of bills to ban transition care for minors and in some cases restrict it for adults; limit transgender people’s participation in competitive sports and which bathrooms they can use; restrict drag shows; prevent schools from acknowledging transgender students’ identities; and more. Politicians and activists also now regularly and baselessly accuse transgender people of pedophilia and “grooming,” resurrecting a campaign that was used against gay people for decades. That was the most commonly cited trope in the documented incidents of harassment and assault. “It’s going to continue,” Professor Levin said, “as (truncated), “Supporting the LGBTQI+ community is a top priority for me and HHS.\" --Secretary Xavier Beccera 𝐇𝐇𝐒 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐋𝐆𝐁𝐓 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚 𝐨𝐧 ‘𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞’ Biden’s Health Department is being weaponized to promote homosexuality and the transgender agenda. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra launched the department’s “Pride Summit” on Monday, stressing the importance of normalizing the LGBT agenda. He quipped, “Supporting the LGBTQI+ community is a top priority for me and HHS. Equity runs at the heart of every initiative we take on here.” Numerous Biden administration officials participated in the event, including White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who identifies as a lesbian, and HHS Assistant Secretary Rachel Levine, a biological man who identifies as a woman. Several other non-governmental LGBT activists were present too, including American Civil Liberties Union “Trans Justice Strategist” Arli Christian and Casey Pick, director of Law and Policy for the Trevor Project, which has hosted sexually explicit online chatrooms for children and teens. The Pride Summit served dual purposes: the first was to laud, in the words of an HHS press release, “the historic actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure that LGBTQI+ communities … have the resources and support they need and deserve.” Under Biden’s tenure, the HHS has turned into a veritable LGBT cheerleading squad, with both Becerra and Levine marching in Pride parades and vociferously promoting gender transition procedures (including genital mutilation surgeries) for minors, flying the “Progress Pride” flag outside HHS headquarters, and hosting a pro-trans roundtable discussion — and that’s just this month’s activities. The second purpose of the Pride Summit was to showcase future HHS endeavors to promote LGBT ideology. Among them are the planned release of a “Behavioral Health Care Advisory on Transgender and Gender Diverse Youth” for mental health experts to use in advocating for harmful gender transition procedures, mandating state child welfare agencies use federal funding to promote gender transition procedures, and efforts to force health care providers to violate their consciences and commit gender transition procedures. Becerra said of the HHS’s efforts, “This game of defense can get tiring. We want offense. Let’s play on the offensive and let’s grow.” The sentiment was echoed by Levine, who tweeted last week, “All summer long we will be celebrating the ‘Summer of Pride.’” He repeated the slogan at the Pride Summit, calling for not just a whole month dedicated to the LGBT agenda but a whole season: “Happy Pride Month, and actually — let’s declare it a summer of Pride.” Speaking on gender transition procedures for children — including puberty blockers, hormone drugs, medically-unnecessary double mastectomies, and genital mutilation surgeries — Levine declared, “We often say that gender-affirming care is healthcare, gender-affirming care is mental healthcare, and gender-affirming care is literally suicide prevention care.” There is no evidence to support Levine’s claims, and there is actually evidence which contradicts it. In fact, Dr. Jennifer Bauwens, Family Research Council’s director of the Center for Family Studies, told The Washington Stand that “this is the most invasive ‘intervention’ that exists to treat any psychological condition and yet it has the least evidence to recommend it.” In a 2021 study authored by Bauwens, she noted that “despite the years of empirical study, there is no clear understanding of etiology in the suicide literature. In other words, there is no clear understanding of the individual and combined risks that cause a person to commit suicide,” yet transgender advocates consistently claim to know definitively, after a cursory period of usually inconsistent research, exactly why teens and adults identifying as transgender commit suicide. Most U.S. studies on the link between gender transition procedures and suicide are largely inconclusive, admitting that there is not enough data available over a long enough period of time. The most thorough study on the subject comes from Sweden. The 30-year-long study found that the suicide rate amongst those who identify as transgender increased after gender transition surgeries, rising to at least 20 times the suicide rate of peers. Back in 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services refused to mandate coverage of gender transition procedures, citing an absence of evidence that such procedures are actually beneficial. That was undone by the Biden administration last year, and health insurance providers are now required to cover gender transition procedures. Conservative author and commentator Matt Walsh’s documentary “What Is a Woman?” also explores the question, highlighting the experiences of those who regret their gender transitions and the increased risk of suicide, especially since underlying psychological issues (truncated)]</td>\n",

Target’s website continues to feature a number of Pride products, including rainbow apparel for adults and kids, as well as a children’s book about pronouns. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom weighed in about the product removal on Twitter, accusing Target’s chief executive of ‘selling out the LGBTQ+ community to extremists.’ Newsom also urged Americans to ‘wake up,’ saying there is a ’systematic attack on the gay community happening across the country.’ Target is the latest, but by no means the first, notable brand to face recent backlash over Pride products and partnerships with members of the LGBTQIA+ community. Bud Light's sales declined in April after some conservatives urged consumers to snub the brand over its partnership with transgender actor and TikTok personality Dylan Mulvaney, the Washington Post reported., After intense backlash and threats to store workers over the merchandise, Target has decided to pull some LGBTQ+ merchandise from the floor ahead of Pride Month. “Since introducing this year’s collection, we’ve experienced threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and well-being while at work,” Target said in a statement Tuesday. ”Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior.” Target declined to say which items it was removing but among the ones that garnered the most attention were “tuck friendly” women’s swimsuits that allow trans women who have not had gender-affirming operations to conceal their private parts.

The Supreme Court's 2015 decision to legalize same-gender marriage remains one of the most tangible and significant wins for LGBTQ+ rights—yet many Americans continue to have complex (and sometimes contradictory) views on transgender issues, suggesting much of the growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has not extended to the trans community. Trans, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people have long been marginalized in the U.S., both through legislation dating as far back as mid-19th century anti-cross-dressing laws and through cultural representation, such as the long-standing portrayal of trans characters as villains in film and television. More recently, after several decades of increased visibility and some legislative wins for the LGBTQ+ community in the aftermath of Stonewall, a wave of conservative backlash targeting trans rights has fully materialized. Already as of March 2023, there are over 400 bills targeting transgender rights active across 46 state legislatures. Nineteen anti-trans laws have been passed since the beginning of the year, according to the Trans Legislation Tracker. Within the past several years, however, one group within the trans community has become the center of what many have dubbed the most recent moral panic: trans youth. Legislation specifically targeting transgender youth began cropping up in state legislatures in 2020. By 2021, laws claiming to \"protect children\" from the \"dangers\" of gender-affirming medical care entered the cultural zeitgeist in earnest—claims that are flatly contradicted by leading scientists and medical organizations' findings that this type of care is not only safe but medically necessary. Some proposed legislation goes as far as naming parental support for a young person's gender-affirming care as child abuse and gives the state the right to take trans children away from their parents. While anti-trans youth legislation outnumbers legislation to protect trans youth, several states have enacted or are considering laws intended to protect trans children. In August 2022, California passed a law providing refuge and gender-affirming care to families escaping anti-trans youth legislation. Colorado—formerly known as the \"Hate State\" for its history of passing anti-LGBTQ+ legislation throughout the 90s—made history when it passed legislation in January 2023 protecting gender-affirming medical care as an essential health benefit, becoming the first state to do so. In 2022, Hawaii passed legislation that requires health insurance companies to cover gender-affirming care deemed medically necessary. Stacker took a look at state-by-state data from the Movement Advancement Project on sexual orientation and gender identity policies that affect transgender youth. All 50 states and Washington D.C. were then ranked by their total policy tallies—the number of laws and policies driving equality for LGBTQ+ people—with #51 being the most restrictive state and #1 being the most protective state for trans youth. Tallies are compared to totals from 2022 and ties are broken, when possible, by the tally for gender-inclusive laws and policies. Negative tallies mean more discrimination laws exist than protection laws. The Movement Advancement Project's policy tally only accounts for passed legislation in each state. It does not take into account activism efforts, public sentiment, or whether these laws are implemented, all of which can potentially differ from the legislative actions of elected officials. Major categories of laws analyzed include \"Relationship and Parental Recognition, Nondiscrimination, Religious Exemptions, LGBTQ Youth, Health Care, Criminal Justice, and Identity Documents.\" Both gender identity and sexual orientation policy tallies are included since many trans individuals are also impacted by sexual orientation legislation.

Already as of March 2023, there are over 400 bills targeting transgender rights active across 46 state legislatures. Nineteen anti-trans laws have been passed since the beginning of the year, according to the Trans Legislation Tracker. Within the past several years, however, one group within the trans community has become the center of what many have dubbed the most recent moral panic: trans youth. Legislation specifically targeting transgender youth began cropping up in state legislatures in 2020. By 2021, laws claiming to \"protect children\" from the \"dangers\" of gender-affirming medical care entered the cultural zeitgeist in earnest—claims that are flatly contradicted by leading scientists and medical organizations' findings that this type of care is not only safe but medically necessary. Some proposed legislation goes as far as naming parental support for a young person's gender-affirming care as child abuse and gives the state the right to take trans children away from their parents. While anti-trans youth legislation outnumbers legislation to protect trans youth, several states have enacted or are considering laws intended to protect trans children. In August 2022, California passed a law providing refuge and gender-affirming care to families escaping anti-trans youth legislation. Colorado—formerly known as the \"Hate State\" for its history of passing anti-LGBTQ+ legislation throughout the 90s—made history when it passed legislation in January 2023 protecting gender-affirming medical care as an essential health benefit, becoming the first state to do so. In 2022, Hawaii passed legislation that requires health insurance companies to cover gender-affirming care deemed medically necessary. Stacker took a look at state-by-state data from the Movement Advancement Project on sexual orientation and gender identity policies that affect transgender youth. All 50 states and Washington D.C. were then ranked by their total policy tallies—the number of laws and policies driving equality for LGBTQ+ people—with #51 being the most restrictive state and #1 being the most protective state for trans youth. Tallies are compared to totals from 2022 and ties are broken, when possible, by the tally for gender-inclusive laws and policies. Negative tallies mean more discrimination laws exist than protection laws. The Movement Advancement Project's policy tally only accounts for passed legislation in each state. It does not take into account activism efforts, public sentiment, or whether these laws are implemented, all of which can potentially differ from the legislative actions of elected officials. Major categories of laws analyzed include \"Relationship and Parental Recognition, Nondiscrimination, Religious Exemptions, LGBTQ Youth, Health Care, Criminal Justice, and Identity Documents.\" Both gender identity and sexual orientation policy tallies are included since many trans individuals are also impacted by sexual orientation legislation.

The violence erupted at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee after a shooter armed with three firearms descended on the Christian school and began spraying bullets indiscriminately. Among the dead were three nine-year old children and the school’s administrator. Police identified the shooter as Audrey Hale, a 28-year-old transgender person who had previously attended the school. (Hale was shot and killed by police officers who quickly responded to the attack.) In the wake of the shooting, partisan quarrels erupted on social media and television, compounding the tragedy. Democrats quickly blamed Republicans for not embracing stricter gun control measures. \"How many more children have to be murdered before Republicans in Congress will step up and act to pass the Assault Weapons Ban?\" asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Many conservatives, meanwhile, seized on Hale's transgender identity, alleging that “transgender terrorists are the largest-growing terrorist group per capita in America,” and suggesting that hormonal treatments might have been to blame. These reactions, sadly, are fairly typical to mass shootings today, but they are not just harmful but false. The truth is Hale is the only person responsible for the heinous act. She bought the weapons and pulled the triggers that claimed those six lives. Transgenderism is not to blame, nor are Republicans who support the Second Amendment. Yet our collective failure to recognize this, and to give in to the temptation to blame political opponents and particular classes for the carnage, was on full display this week. One former US Senator suggested a Congressman who posed with his family for a holiday photo was somehow to blame for Monday’s atrocity because they were pictured with firearms. A high profile conservative account, meanwhile, shared a picture of one of the victims and said “the Left is pure evil.” (The post was retweeted more than 11,000 times.) A left wing influencer, in a post later deleted, suggested that perhaps the victims were at fault for not “praying enough.” Numerous others have argued that transgender individuals should be stripped of their Second Amendment rights because they are “mentally ill.” These posts are all problematic for various reasons, but they share a common theme: each deflects blame from the person solely responsible for the tragedy in Nashville—the shooter—and places it on individuals or groups that had nothing to do with the crime. This isn’t just unfair to the people or groups accused, it also fans hatred and dehumanizes them. Author David Livingstone explored dehumanization in his award-winning 2012 book Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others. The process of dehumanization, which caused the worst atrocities in modern history, from the Holocaust to Abu Ghraib and beyond, begins, he notes, when individuals of one group begin to “see themselves as quite distinct from members of another, and may then treat group and non-group individuals differently.” Blaming people—whether they be Christians, transgender people, or gun-toting Republicans—for a heinous crime they had no part in is a step toward dehumanization, and runs counter to the American ethos of individualism, which holds that a person’s individual rights and basic worth have nothing to do with their group identity. This does not mean, of course, that we must stifle debates around transgenderism or gun control. It’s perfectly appropriate to discuss both. What must be resisted is the impulse to blame other groups for crimes they had no part in, to see them as collectively evil because they don’t support the same public policies you do, pray to a different God, or live a lifestyle you reject. As the authors of The Anatomy of Peace have observed, when we dehumanize others we dehumanize ourselves. And by rushing to see political opponents as uncaring monsters, we overlook a dark truth about the actual nature of evil. “The line between good and evil runs not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either—but right through every human heart,” the Nobel Prize-winning author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn famously noted.

Critics say the San Francisco Chronicle's statement that attacks on trans athletes are scientifically unfounded is ridiculous and that it flies in the face of established biological differences. A recent study confirms that there is a significant performance gap between males and females in various sports, a gap that can range from 10% to 50%. While some deem hormone suppression to be a solution, even this only minimally reduces the muscular advantages enjoyed by trans women. The inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports undermines the fairness of competition, and society must strike a balance between inclusion and fair play. #sports - summary © am1.news - Read the original story and more like it on our website.

At the April 13 School Committee Meeting for Middleboro, Mass. Public Schools, 7th grader Liam Morrison, a student at Nichols Middle School, stepped up to the microphone for two minutes of public comment — and then reached up to turn it down towards his mouth. He then narrated for the school committee what might be the silliest reason any student has ever been sent home from school: wearing a shirt conveying factually accurate information. “I never thought the shirt I wore to school on March 21 would lead me to speak with you today,” began the pint-sized culture warrior. He described how he was removed from his Tuesday gym class “to sit down with two adults for what turned out to be a very uncomfortable talk. I was told that people were complaining about the words on my shirt, that my shirt was making some students feel unsafe.” “What did my shirt say? Five simple words: ‘There are only two genders,’ Morrison emphasized. “Nothing harmful. Nothing threatening. Just a statement I believe to be a fact.” And not only a fact, but a bedrock principle to many lessons Morrison would likely have encountered in both biology class and grammar class. “Yes, words on a shirt made people feel ‘unsafe,’” repeated Morrison. If people did complain, they lacked the courage to tell Morrison to his face. In this instance, the accused was not accorded the right to face his accusers, making their very existence unverifiable. Morrison recalled, “Not one person, student, or staff, told me that they were bothered by what I was wearing. Actually, just the opposite. Several kids told me that they supported my actions and that they wanted one, too.” “I was told that I would need to remove my shirt before I could return to class,” Morrison continued. “When I nicely told them that I didn’t want to do that, they called my father. Thankfully, my dad supported my decisions [and] came to pick me up.” In other words, because Morrison’s shirt proclaimed a fact of biology and language that he learned (or should have learned) in school, school personnel sent him home — which would hinder his ability to learn — to quarantine his knowledge from other students. School personnel tried to justify their decision to Morrison, who said, “Their arguments were weak, in my opinion.” The Nichols Middle School dress code does not prohibit students from wearing clothing that displays a message — which is sometimes the case in a controversy of this nature — and school personnel did not object to Morrison’s shirt on that basis. Instead, they claimed that the shirt was disruptive and targeted a protected class. The dress code does provide: “Clothing that … inhibits learning is not allowed.” “Clothing must not state, imply, or depict hate speech or imagery that target groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, or any other classification.” “I was told that this shirt was a disruption to learning,” said Morrison. But “no one got up and stormed out of class. No one burst into tears. I’m sure I would have noticed if they had. I experience disruptions to my learning every day. Kids acting out in class are a disruption, yet nothing is done. Why do the rules apply to one yet not another?” A healthy measure of common sense lies underneath the crew cut. “I have been told that my shirt was ‘targeting a protected class,’” explained Morrison. But he had questions. “Who is this protected class? Are their feelings more important than my rights? I don’t complain when I see pride flags and diversity posters hung throughout the school. Do you know why? Because others have a right to their beliefs just as I do.” Here Morrison argues for the basic principle of free speech, that merely holding and stating a political opinion does not count as hate speech against anyone who disagrees. It’s not the dress code itself that Morrison spoke out against, but the illegitimate, arbitrary, and unequal way school personnel enforced it against him for his disfavored political views. Per the dress code policy, Morrison was asked to change. “If students wear something inappropriate to school, they will be asked to call their parent/guardian to request that more appropriate attire be brought to school.” Since he was unwilling, and his father supported his decision, he was sent home. Yet Morrison could face “disciplinary action” if he wears the shirt to school again. Even while they were enforcing the dress code policy against Morrison, the school officials seemed reluctant to admit what they were doing. “They told me that I wasn’t in trouble, but it sure felt like I was,” said Morrison. “I feel like these adults were telling me that it wasn’t okay for me to have an opposing view.” But (truncated), A middle school student in Massachusetts said he was sent home from school in March for wearing a shirt that said, \"There are only two genders.\", Twelve-year-old Liam Morrison was sent home from school for wearing a t-shirt that said \"There are only two genders.\"]</td>\n",

He has a history of aggressively promoting transgender ideology, and has encouraged many young people to engage in self-destructive treatments. Despite this, Benestad was awarded a professorship, and is known for calling himself “the world’s best” specialist in the field of gender-affirmative treatment. One of his victims, Alexander Linkowski, described his own experience with Benestad in a heart-breaking YouTube video entitled “My Detransition Story: The dark truth behind gender dysphoria and transition regret.” Benestad’s right to practice medicine has recently been restored, sparking concern for the welfare of future patients. #health - summary © am1.news - Read the original story and more like it on our website. We can only share about 20% of our full news feed on Facebook www.am1.news, Esben Benestad, a prominent physician in Norway, who also presented as Esther Pirelli, has lost his medical license due to gross professional irresponsibility. Benestad has been a nationwide celebrity and a pioneer in the field of gender dysphoria, known for prescribing puberty blockers to children as young as eleven after only a few chats on Skype and performing mastectomies on female-to-male patients under false pretenses. Benestad's actions and views were radically at odds with medical consensus, which previously diagnosed transgender people with a mental infirmity known as “gender identity disorder,” and has led to a period of reckoning for physicians, sexologists, psychologists, social workers, teachers, and parents who have pushed young people into transgender \"treatments.\" VG, Norway’s largest newspaper, recently exposed Benestad's whole reprehensible racket and sheer egomania. Although Benestad professed that his action against him would negatively affect his patients who “experience gender incongruence” and who otherwise have “nowhere to go,” he has done significant harm to an entire country's understanding of gender. The decision-makers in the Norwegian academy, media, and medical establishment who gave Benestad underserved power, influence, and attention are now seen in contempt. - © am1.news, Though the number of gender-affirming care providers in the Granite State is limited, a few New Hampshire mental health professionals have launched a coalition to help people find these resources. The Gender Diverse Care Coalition of New Hampshire offers free training opportunities, consultations with providers, resource sharing and advocacy work. Harvey Feldman, a licensed therapist based in Concord, is one of the coalition’s founders. He, along with New Hampshire-based therapists Deb Horton and Xavier Quinn, worked together to launch a website for the coalition in early 2022. “I don’t think that it’s a question of not enough providers by number,” he said. “It’s an issue of providers who, out of probably an abundance of too much caution, don’t feel comfortable working with gender-diverse folks.” For transgender people, receiving gender-affirming health care is a necessary step for both mental and physical wellness. Regardless of whether they seek transition-related care, transgender people need access to routine health care throughout their lives — just like anyone else. “There’s a real underlying belief here that [gender-affirming care] is elective, that it’s a choice people are making,” Feldman said. “This is not seen as health care, and I think that’s sort of a fundamental piece of trying to have a conversation here. If you don’t see it as health care, then none of the rest of the conversation makes sense.” You can read more about the coalition, in our first story from a solutions journalism series about gaps in gender-affirming care, by James Rinker:  Photos by Hannah Schroeder @schroeh. #transgender #healthcare #genderaffirmingcare #transhealth]</td>\n",

Advocates are pushing for pronouns to align with a person's self-identified gender rather than their assigned sex at birth. As of 2023, there are a total of 107 identified gender identities. One's happiness and self-acceptance should not depend on the approval of others but should be rooted in an authentic understanding of their identity in Christ. 👉To read the full story click the image below!👇 #Charismamedia #CharismaNews Vlad Savchuk Hungry Generation #peace #happiness #approval #Jesus, La Sierra University Church will hold the “I Am Affirmed” LGBT+ Graduation Ceremony on the Lord's Sabbath Adventist education is in the midst of monumental changes. On Sabbath, June 3, 2023, La Sierra University will be celebrating a special graduation ceremony “to honor lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and ally students and to acknowledge their achievements and contributions to the university.” Even though the rest of the 2023 graduating class will not have their ceremony celebrated until Sunday, June 18, 2023, this Sabbath service is a special ceremony to recognize LGBT+ students. Paul Mallery, Chair of La Sierra University’s (LSU) Psychology Department, sent the following email along with an attached flyer advertising the “I Am Affirmed” LGBT+ graduation to all of LSU’s community: “The La Sierra University Church Kinship Sabbath School is organizing a Lavender Graduation Service for Class of 2023 graduates. Any graduating student from our local community who identifies as LGBT+ is welcome to participate. The date is June 3rd at 6:30pm at Sierra Vista Chapel. Students can RSVP at tinyurl.com/sdalavgrad23 (before May 12 preferred).” For Professor Mallery to send a “community” email to everyone on campus through LSU’s email server means that this “I Am Affirmed” LGBT+ graduation had to have approval from the university’s administration. In fact, the flyer states that this event will take place at the La Sierra University Church, a Seventh-day Adventist Church congregation. Adventist institutions are being targeted by a massive LGBT+ campaign, and La Sierra University is leading the way in LGBT+ affirmation. The message that was publicized to the entire LSU community is that the LGBT+ agenda is now being affirmed by school administrators. These initiatives aim to normalize the LGBT+ lifestyle among our youth. It is impossible to deny that there is a crisis of faith when we witness churches and other religious institutions openly supporting the LGBT+ agenda. The clear moral teachings of the church are being replaced. The modern church today spends its time accepting the radical gender theories of the LGBT+ movement rather than reaffirming the faith and the fundamental truths of God’s word. We would rather proclaim the LGBT+ gospel, climate change theories, and social justice instead of proclaiming the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ that calls for repentance and conversion (Acts 3:19). #sda #adventist #adventista Click to read the full story: , ACNA BISHOP AFFIRMS TRADITIONAL VIEWS ON SEXUALITY. BLASTS NON-BINARY SELF DECLARATIONS Undergoing surgery, taking hormones, or non-binary self-declarations cannot change who God created you to be, said Bishop Julian Dobbs. Lines of demarcation have been drawn in our nation, he said. Archbishop Welby and his bishops are leading the church into apostasy. \"They are walking apart from Christ.\" The Church of England will cease to exist around 2060. The Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Living Word, The Rt. Rev. Julian Dobbs affirmed traditional views on human sexuality in a sermon to 300 delegates at the 10th ADLW Diocesan convention, held recently in Souderton, PA. \"Male and female he created them. Undergoing surgery, taking hormones, or non-binary self-declarations cannot change who God created you to be. The determination of your sex belongs not to you, your parents, your psychotherapist, your surgeon or anyone else. It belongs to God alone. God reserves for Himself the exclusive right to choose whether a person is male or female.\" \"We have men created in the image of God and we have women created in the image of God. Nothing else! There is no X -- unspecified or Y -- undisclosed, only male and female created in the image of God. Human beings, male and female, are God's masterpiece. Everything else that staggers our imagination and wows our heart and mind, everything else in creation that fills our eyes with astonishment, everything else is secondary to God's creation of male and female in his own image. You just can't read Genesis chapter one and be in any doubt about that!\" The bishop said the distinction is exceedingly relevant for our present day. \"We are living in a cultural moment in which there is increasing confusion about the significance of God's created order and about whether Christians should think about being male or female as something that is given and fixed, or as something that is to a substantial degree malleable and self-chosen.\" \"Being male or female is part of God's created design in His image. There are males and there are females and there is nothing else. Scientific research and discovery with its ability to look at DNA only confirms what we find in the Bible, male and female he created them.\" \"But bishop,\" you might say, \"You do not understand my situation, or that of my son or daughter, my nephew or my niece!\" I would say to you: when we believe the Bible to be the Word of God written, we give the Bible precedence to determine and interpret the details of our lives and if our life's experience contradicts the Bible, we must give the Bible interpretive authority. This is what it means to be a Bible believing follower of Christ. \"Many people today believe that human beings have all crawled their way through the primordial slime, up through the food chain to become homo sapiens and that we are just animals like other creatures that run around in the woods. And as a result, there is nothing special about our humanity; so if we want to identify as male, that is our choice and if we want to identity as female, that too, is our choice.\" \"The resulting chaos of this type of foolishness is on display across our nation. A profound deconstruction of our biological sex, which undermines the fundamental order established by God Himself, reflecting the very essence of who He is and who we were created to be, is taking place within every arena of society. When God's order is deconstructed and redefined, the consequences for sexuality, gender, marriage, family and society are profound. And when this deconstruction is aided by those who profess to follow Christ, it is a scandal.\" Read more: ]</td>\n",

Calls for authorities to release what Hale left behind have grown in the weeks since the shootings. In April, Nashville police confirmed that they would release the manifesto recovered from the car of Hale, a 28-year-old transgender former student. The release, however, was delayed with the police department blaming pending litigation for the holdup. #crime - summary © am1.news - Read the original story and more like it on our website.

In a tweet, Gaines asked tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams how they feel about males competing against women. Gaines became outspoken on preserving women's sports for biological females after tying for fifth with transgender swimmer Lia Thomas in the 200-meter NCAA championship last year. Gaines called on women and girls to boycott competing against trans athletes to raise awareness and ensure their sports are only for biological females. She stated that more athletes will first have to be robbed of titles for enough people to stand up and demand women's sports be reserved for biological females. Transgender athletes have proven successful in women’s sports, but Gaines believes allowing biological men into women’s sports \"doesn’t work.\" - summary © am1.news - Read the original story and more like it on our website.

              "0   [QUESTION: Marty; This seems that the onslaught against Trump is a desperate attempt fearing that he would stop the war and reverse climate change. I have been reading you for years. You have great sources but also a great insight into what is happening in this corrupt world. I used to question your warnings that the United States would end up in a civil war. I’m at the point I cannot see how it is not possible. Are they really this stupid to go after Trump if he could still become president even if convicted? FS ANSWER: This is an absolutely desperate attempt to make sure Trump does not ever get back to the White House. Even if he does, the talk in DC is that they will use this conviction for impeachment. But that would not really pass the test since it would be before taking office unless they stretch it out until January after he is sworn in. Nevertheless, there is far too much on the line for the Neocons. They will assassinate him as a last resort. These people assume the public is stupid and it will all blow over in 30 days anyhow when football season begins. They really do believe like the Romans, give is sports and they can do as they like. If we look at the indictment, 31 of the 37 counts brought against Trump allege he willfully retained national defense information, which is a violation of the Espionage Act. This is really a stretch for the intent of that act was espionage and nobody is making a case that Trump was handing it to an enemy. Nevertheless, the indictment was extremely dangerous and far more serious than what Nixon faced. They are not playing games. They are desperately staging this to put him in prison. Still, there is no actual smoking gun as they say. Trump has spoken about the classified documents acknowledging that they were classified. This is a serious risk and only a jury with common sense would find him not guilty. They use conspiracy so they do not have to prove everything beyond a reasonable doubt. It will be a case arguing what they “think” was in his mind at the time. Even this is selective prosecution after Biden had classified documents thrown in his car. They are already trying to recuse the judge, They want a hanging judge and that is how the government works. When Judge McKenna was protecting me. they made a recusal motion. He denied it. So they went to the Chief Judge and had the case removed and sent to a hanging judge – John F. Kennan – a former prosecutor. Here is my docket sheet. How they remove Judge McKenna was sealed. I was NEVER allowed to see which is an outright violation of Due Process of Law. It does not matter. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals refused to ever address anything in my case whatsoever! I confront Judge Owen that he was altering the transcripts which is a felony. I forced him to admit it. Under the law, he should have recused himself for now he was a witness in my case. I tried to appeal that and the Second Circuit lost the appeal 3 times. Now you can see what Thomas Jefferson was writing about. There is no rule of law in the United States. If they want you, you have ZERO constitutional or human rights. They even tried to kill me in the same place they killed Jeffrey Epstein. I was in the hospital in a coma but to their dismay, I survived. Shakespeare’s famous line from Henry VI, “The first thing we do, let’s kill all the lawyers” must be put in its proper context. At that point in history, a charged persona had NO RIGHT to counsel. The ONLY lawyers were actually the king’s prosecutors. So you can see, even Shakespeare understood how the rule of law is a joke. Even Charles Dickens has written about how corrupt the legal system had become back in 1853. Dickens wrote in Chapter I, “In Chancery” of his celebrated Bleake House, “Suffer any wrong that can be done you, rather than come here!” Indeed, the current state of American federal courts has once again reached the lowest point completing the revolution of the wheel of political fortune. Perhaps this is in line with what we should expect as we move into 2032 where governments around the world will collapse from their own internal corruption. Trump should kiss the wife and kids goodbye, for he has little chance of defeating this corrupt system. As Herbert Hoover wrote: “Sometimes when a government; is enraged, it burns down the barn to get the rat.” This is how the law is just always abused. If a parent is against transgenderism, in California Newsome wants to charge them with child abuse. That would allow courts to take custody of children awake from the parent under old laws. If a child under 18 cannot have sex consensually, how can then change their sex? Good luck with ANY California judge ruling in your favor. Kiss your children goodbye as well if they are brainwashed into thinking they should change their sex even at age 7 to 12. A 17-year-old cannot consent to sex, but to vaccinate minors without parental consent was OK because a minor can consent to be vaccinated, but (truncated), Our American world grows more depressing by the week. If you don't believe me, just check out this Maggie Astor report in the New York Times. Tom \"There were more than 350 incidents of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment, vandalism or assault in the United States from June 2022 through April 2023, according to a new report, reflecting a climate in which bias against gay and especially transgender people has become widespread. The incidents, which were reported in 46 states and the District of Columbia, included online harassment, gatherings of armed protesters outside drag shows, and bomb threats against hospitals that provide gender transition care. They also included the mass shooting in November at an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub in Colorado.\"  The report was produced by the Anti-Defamation League and the L.G.B.T.Q. advocacy group GLAAD, which collected data from news coverage as well as direct reports from victims. As with other attempts to quantify attacks on marginalized groups, the numbers in the report are certain to be undercounts, because many people don’t report their experiences. By far the most frequent targets noted in the report were drag shows and drag performers, who were the victims in 138 incidents. Other common targets were schools and educators, health care facilities and providers, and government buildings and officials. California, Florida, New York and Texas had the most incidents, but they are also the most populous states. The report uses similar methodology to what A.D.L. has long used to produce reports about incidents of antisemitism. It is the first time A.D.L. and GLAAD have compiled a report on homophobic and transphobic incidents. Sarah Moore, an analyst of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. extremism for both organizations, said they plan to release new editions annually from now on. “Hard data like this backs up what so many of us in the L.G.B.T.Q. community are unfortunately experiencing right now,” said Sarah Kate Ellis, the president of GLAAD. “That revolting anti-gay comment you saw on a neighbor’s social media page, that shocking disinformation about trans youth you heard at a school board meeting, and that attack by extremists at your local Drag Story Hour — these are not isolated events.” Because this is the first such report, it does not show how the prevalence of anti-L.G.B.T.Q. harassment and violence has changed over time. But there are indications that they are increasing: As of Tuesday, A.D.L. and GLAAD had documented 101 such incidents in the first three weeks of June, which is Pride Month. That is more than twice the number the organizations counted from last June. An upcoming report from the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino shows a 52 percent increase in anti-L.G.B.T.Q. hate crimes around the country in 2022 and a 28 percent increase in the narrower anti-transgender category, according to the center’s director, Prof. Brian Levin. It also shows a 47 percent increase in hate crimes against gender-nonconforming people, which the report defines as including drag performers. That report looks only at incidents in major cities and focuses specifically on hate crimes. By contrast, not all of the incidents in the A.D.L. and GLAAD report would be classified as crimes. Nearly half of the incidents in the report from A.D.L. and GLAAD involved perpetrators associated with extremist groups, such as the Proud Boys or neo-Nazi organizations. And the report found significant overlap with other forms of bias: Of the 356 anti-L.G.B.T.Q. incidents it counted, antisemitism was also a factor in 128, and racism in 30. But Ms. Moore said it was also striking that half of the incidents were unconnected to extremist groups. That finding, she said, reflects the degree to which anti-L.G.B.T.Q. sentiment is “being mainstreamed in society and being picked up on by local church groups, local parents’ rights groups, whatever might be the local grass-roots movement for the Republican Party.” Historical data indicates that increases in hate crimes are closely related to increases in hateful rhetoric from politicians and other influential figures, Professor Levin said, adding that he was very concerned about the current trend. This year, Republican lawmakers have passed dozens of bills to ban transition care for minors and in some cases restrict it for adults; limit transgender people’s participation in competitive sports and which bathrooms they can use; restrict drag shows; prevent schools from acknowledging transgender students’ identities; and more. Politicians and activists also now regularly and baselessly accuse transgender people of pedophilia and “grooming,” resurrecting a campaign that was used against gay people for decades. That was the most commonly cited trope in the documented incidents of harassment and assault. “It’s going to continue,” Professor Levin said, “as (truncated), “Supporting the LGBTQI+ community is a top priority for me and HHS.\" --Secretary Xavier Beccera 𝐇𝐇𝐒 𝐓𝐚𝐤𝐞𝐬 𝐋𝐆𝐁𝐓 𝐀𝐠𝐞𝐧𝐝𝐚 𝐨𝐧 ‘𝐎𝐟𝐟𝐞𝐧𝐬𝐞’ Biden’s Health Department is being weaponized to promote homosexuality and the transgender agenda. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Xavier Becerra launched the department’s “Pride Summit” on Monday, stressing the importance of normalizing the LGBT agenda. He quipped, “Supporting the LGBTQI+ community is a top priority for me and HHS. Equity runs at the heart of every initiative we take on here.” Numerous Biden administration officials participated in the event, including White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre, who identifies as a lesbian, and HHS Assistant Secretary Rachel Levine, a biological man who identifies as a woman. Several other non-governmental LGBT activists were present too, including American Civil Liberties Union “Trans Justice Strategist” Arli Christian and Casey Pick, director of Law and Policy for the Trevor Project, which has hosted sexually explicit online chatrooms for children and teens. The Pride Summit served dual purposes: the first was to laud, in the words of an HHS press release, “the historic actions taken by the Biden-Harris Administration to ensure that LGBTQI+ communities … have the resources and support they need and deserve.” Under Biden’s tenure, the HHS has turned into a veritable LGBT cheerleading squad, with both Becerra and Levine marching in Pride parades and vociferously promoting gender transition procedures (including genital mutilation surgeries) for minors, flying the “Progress Pride” flag outside HHS headquarters, and hosting a pro-trans roundtable discussion — and that’s just this month’s activities. The second purpose of the Pride Summit was to showcase future HHS endeavors to promote LGBT ideology. Among them are the planned release of a “Behavioral Health Care Advisory on Transgender and Gender Diverse Youth” for mental health experts to use in advocating for harmful gender transition procedures, mandating state child welfare agencies use federal funding to promote gender transition procedures, and efforts to force health care providers to violate their consciences and commit gender transition procedures. Becerra said of the HHS’s efforts, “This game of defense can get tiring. We want offense. Let’s play on the offensive and let’s grow.” The sentiment was echoed by Levine, who tweeted last week, “All summer long we will be celebrating the ‘Summer of Pride.’” He repeated the slogan at the Pride Summit, calling for not just a whole month dedicated to the LGBT agenda but a whole season: “Happy Pride Month, and actually — let’s declare it a summer of Pride.” Speaking on gender transition procedures for children — including puberty blockers, hormone drugs, medically-unnecessary double mastectomies, and genital mutilation surgeries — Levine declared, “We often say that gender-affirming care is healthcare, gender-affirming care is mental healthcare, and gender-affirming care is literally suicide prevention care.” There is no evidence to support Levine’s claims, and there is actually evidence which contradicts it. In fact, Dr. Jennifer Bauwens, Family Research Council’s director of the Center for Family Studies, told The Washington Stand that “this is the most invasive ‘intervention’ that exists to treat any psychological condition and yet it has the least evidence to recommend it.” In a 2021 study authored by Bauwens, she noted that “despite the years of empirical study, there is no clear understanding of etiology in the suicide literature. In other words, there is no clear understanding of the individual and combined risks that cause a person to commit suicide,” yet transgender advocates consistently claim to know definitively, after a cursory period of usually inconsistent research, exactly why teens and adults identifying as transgender commit suicide. Most U.S. studies on the link between gender transition procedures and suicide are largely inconclusive, admitting that there is not enough data available over a long enough period of time. The most thorough study on the subject comes from Sweden. The 30-year-long study found that the suicide rate amongst those who identify as transgender increased after gender transition surgeries, rising to at least 20 times the suicide rate of peers. Back in 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services refused to mandate coverage of gender transition procedures, citing an absence of evidence that such procedures are actually beneficial.

#CityofGoleta is proud to recognize and celebrate #LGBTQ+ Pride Month with our Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, & Queer Community. The Goleta City Council recognized June 2023 as LGBTQ+ Pride Month with a proclamation at its June 6, 2023, City Council meeting. Pacific Pride Foundation Executive Director Kristen Flickinger was on hand to accept the proclamation. LGBTQ+ individuals in the United States have fought for equal treatment, dignity, and respect, and remain determined to pursue full equality, respect, and inclusion for all individuals regardless of sexual orientation, gender identity or gender expression. Despite being marginalized throughout the history of the United States, LGBTQ+ individuals continue to celebrate their identities, love, and contributions in various expressions of Pride. The City Council encourages the Goleta community to join in celebration and appreciation of the LGBTQ+ community.

of its Pride Month merchandise in response to customer backlash, saying the move is intended to protect employees from threats and in-store outbursts by shoppers. ‘Since introducing this year’s collection, we’ve experienced threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and well-being while at work,’ Target wrote Tuesday in a company statement. ‘Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior.’ The company did not specify which items would be removed, though its ’tuck-friendly’ swimsuits have drawn particular ire from several conservative TV networks and internet personalities in recent days. Target’s website continues to feature a number of Pride products, including rainbow apparel for adults and kids, as well as a children’s book about pronouns. Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom weighed in about the product removal on Twitter, accusing Target’s chief executive of ‘selling out the LGBTQ+ community to extremists.’ Newsom also urged Americans to ‘wake up,’ saying there is a ’systematic attack on the gay community happening across the country.’ Target is the latest, but by no means the first, notable brand to face recent backlash over Pride products and partnerships with members of the LGBTQIA+ community. Bud Light's sales declined in April after some conservatives urged consumers to snub the brand over its partnership with transgender actor and TikTok personality Dylan Mulvaney, the Washington Post reported., After intense backlash and threats to store workers over the merchandise, Target has decided to pull some LGBTQ+ merchandise from the floor ahead of Pride Month. “Since introducing this year’s collection, we’ve experienced threats impacting our team members’ sense of safety and well-being while at work,” Target said in a statement Tuesday. ”Given these volatile circumstances, we are making adjustments to our plans, including removing items that have been at the center of the most significant confrontational behavior.” Target declined to say which items it was removing but among the ones that garnered the most attention were “tuck friendly” women’s swimsuits that allow trans women who have not had gender-affirming operations to conceal their private parts. Designs by Abprallen, a London-based company that designs and sells occult- and satanic-themed LGBTQ+ clothing and accessories, have also created backlash. The Pride merchandise has been on sale since early May. Pride month is held in June. Target confirmed that it has moved its Pride merchandise from the front of the stores to the back in some Southern stores after confrontations and backlash from shoppers in those areas. , This month, retail giant Target, reached a new level of evil with their 2023 \"PRIDE\" collection.⁠ ⁠ For years, Target has sold exclusive merchandise and apparel for \"pride\" month, but this year, they have gone so far as to partner with an outspoken Satanist to design some of their products.⁠ ⁠ \"Abprallen,\" a U.K.-based clothing company led by designer and transgender Satanist Erik Carnell, created several pro-LGBTQ+ clothing items for Target's PRIDE Month line, which also includes \"tuck-friendly\" swimwear, onesies for infants and various apparel for toddlers and small children.⁠ ⁠ As one of the first retail chains to make their bathrooms and changing rooms \"gender-neutral\" and who, last year, introduced a line of packing underwear and chest binders, their 2023 \"PRIDE\" collection is disturbing, even for them.⁠ ⁠ Will you join us in standing for biblical truth and sign our petition to stop shopping at Target until they reverse this heinous decision and apologize for targeting our children and attempting to undermine the values we share?⁠ ⁠ Our goal is to gather thousands of signatures and deliver them to Target's corporate leadership. Thank you in advance for signing the petition!⁠ ⁠ 📝 frc.org/target \"I, the undersigned, am outraged by the actions of Target. Their decision to design and sell clothing meant to target children for indoctrination into the LGBTQ+ agenda violates my deeply held personal convictions, grounded in biblical truth and faith in the Gospel of Jesus Christ. The Word of God as revealed in Scripture stands in clear opposition to the ideologies that Target has chosen to support. Since Target has chosen to promote sinful ideologies and to target our children in the process, as a matter of faith, personal conviction, and stewardship of the resources that God has given me, I will not support Target by giving my money to them. I will not shop at Target until such a time as this decision is reversed and the company apologizes for undermining our values and targeting our children with indoctrination into LGBTQ+ ideology.\" Sign here: frc.org/target]  \n",

The Supreme Court's 2015 decision to legalize same-gender marriage remains one of the most tangible and significant wins for LGBTQ+ rights—yet many Americans continue to have complex (and sometimes contradictory) views on transgender issues, suggesting much of the growing acceptance of LGBTQ+ people has not extended to the trans community. Trans, nonbinary, and gender-nonconforming people have long been marginalized in the U.S., both through legislation dating as far back as mid-19th century anti-cross-dressing laws and through cultural representation, such as the long-standing portrayal of trans characters as villains in film and television. More recently, after several decades of increased visibility and some legislative wins for the LGBTQ+ community in the aftermath of Stonewall, a wave of conservative backlash targeting trans rights has fully materialized. Already as of March 2023, there are over 400 bills targeting transgender rights active across 46 state legislatures. Nineteen anti-trans laws have been passed since the beginning of the year, according to the Trans Legislation Tracker. Within the past several years, however, one group within the trans community has become the center of what many have dubbed the most recent moral panic: trans youth. Legislation specifically targeting transgender youth began cropping up in state legislatures in 2020. By 2021, laws claiming to \"protect children\" from the \"dangers\" of gender-affirming medical care entered the cultural zeitgeist in earnest—claims that are flatly contradicted by leading scientists and medical organizations' findings that this type of care is not only safe but medically necessary. Some proposed legislation goes as far as naming parental support for a young person's gender-affirming care as child abuse and gives the state the right to take trans children away from their parents. While anti-trans youth legislation outnumbers legislation to protect trans youth, several states have enacted or are considering laws intended to protect trans children. In August 2022, California passed a law providing refuge and gender-affirming care to families escaping anti-trans youth legislation. Colorado—formerly known as the \"Hate State\" for its history of passing anti-LGBTQ+ legislation throughout the 90s—made history when it passed legislation in January 2023 protecting gender-affirming medical care as an essential health benefit, becoming the first state to do so. In 2022, Hawaii passed legislation that requires health insurance companies to cover gender-affirming care deemed medically necessary. Stacker took a look at state-by-state data from the Movement Advancement Project on sexual orientation and gender identity policies that affect transgender youth. All 50 states and Washington D.C. were then ranked by their total policy tallies—the number of laws and policies driving equality for LGBTQ+ people—with #51 being the most restrictive state and #1 being the most protective state for trans youth. Tallies are compared to totals from 2022 and ties are broken, when possible, by the tally for gender-inclusive laws and policies. Negative tallies mean more discrimination laws exist than protection laws. The Movement Advancement Project's policy tally only accounts for passed legislation in each state. It does not take into account activism efforts, public sentiment, or whether these laws are implemented, all of which can potentially differ from the legislative actions of elected officials. Major categories of laws analyzed include \"Relationship and Parental Recognition, Nondiscrimination, Religious Exemptions, LGBTQ Youth, Health Care, Criminal Justice, and Identity Documents.\" Both gender identity and sexual orientation policy tallies are included since many trans individuals are also impacted by sexual orientation legislation.

heightened the fears of a community already on edge amid a historic push for more restrictions on trans people’s rights this year., Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and the Danger in Fomenting Group Hatred After Mass Shootings By Jon Miltimore Americans once again found themselves reeling from a mass shooting that claimed the lives of several children last month. The violence erupted at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee after a shooter armed with three firearms descended on the Christian school and began spraying bullets indiscriminately. Among the dead were three nine-year old children and the school’s administrator. Police identified the shooter as Audrey Hale, a 28-year-old transgender person who had previously attended the school. (Hale was shot and killed by police officers who quickly responded to the attack.) In the wake of the shooting, partisan quarrels erupted on social media and television, compounding the tragedy. Democrats quickly blamed Republicans for not embracing stricter gun control measures. \"How many more children have to be murdered before Republicans in Congress will step up and act to pass the Assault Weapons Ban?\" asked White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Many conservatives, meanwhile, seized on Hale's transgender identity, alleging that “transgender terrorists are the largest-growing terrorist group per capita in America,” and suggesting that hormonal treatments might have been to blame. These reactions, sadly, are fairly typical to mass shootings today, but they are not just harmful but false. The truth is Hale is the only person responsible for the heinous act. She bought the weapons and pulled the triggers that claimed those six lives. Transgenderism is not to blame, nor are Republicans who support the Second Amendment. Yet our collective failure to recognize this, and to give in to the temptation to blame political opponents and particular classes for the carnage, was on full display this week. One former US Senator suggested a Congressman who posed with his family for a holiday photo was somehow to blame for Monday’s atrocity because they were pictured with firearms. A high profile conservative account, meanwhile, shared a picture of one of the victims and said “the Left is pure evil.” (The post was retweeted more than 11,000 times.) A left wing influencer, in a post later deleted, suggested that perhaps the victims were at fault for not “praying enough.” Numerous others have argued that transgender individuals should be stripped of their Second Amendment rights because they are “mentally ill.” These posts are all problematic for various reasons, but they share a common theme: each deflects blame from the person solely responsible for the tragedy in Nashville—the shooter—and places it on individuals or groups that had nothing to do with the crime. This isn’t just unfair to the people or groups accused, it also fans hatred and dehumanizes them. Author David Livingstone explored dehumanization in his award-winning 2012 book Less Than Human: Why We Demean, Enslave, and Exterminate Others. The process of dehumanization, which caused the worst atrocities in modern history, from the Holocaust to Abu Ghraib and beyond, begins, he notes, when individuals of one group begin to “see themselves as quite distinct from members of another, and may then treat group and non-group individuals differently.” Blaming people—whether they be Christians, transgender people, or gun-toting Republicans—for a heinous crime they had no part in is a step toward dehumanization, and runs counter to the American ethos of individualism, which holds that a person’s individual rights and basic worth have nothing to do with their group identity. This does not mean, of course, that we must stifle debates around transgenderism or gun control. It’s perfectly appropriate to discuss both. What must be resisted is the impulse to blame other groups for crimes they had no part in, to see them as collectively evil because they don’t support the same public policies you do, pray to a different God, or live a lifestyle you reject. As the authors of The Anatomy of Peace have observed, when we dehumanize others we dehumanize ourselves. And by rushing to see political opponents as uncaring monsters, we overlook a dark truth about the actual nature of evil. “The line between good and evil runs not through states, nor between classes, nor between political parties either—but right through every human heart,” the Nobel Prize-winning author Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn famously noted.

When Davina McCall described a JK Rowling podcast as “interesting”, they went nuts. They damned her as a witch. This is a sexist crusade against women’s free speech, says Brendan O’Neill, The misogyny of the trans lobby becomes clearer every day. Witness their mad meltdown over Davina McCall describing a JK Rowling podcast as “interesting”. They really cannot abide a woman with an opinion, says Brendan O’Neill, Every day, Americans are assaulted by psychological warfare demanding they accept \"transgenderism.\" But the \"trans\" agenda goes far beyond creating tolerance for people with gender dysphoria. There’s a diabolical agenda to ultimately eradicate biological humanity, whether \"trans\" activists know it or not. In this episode, we look at powerful and influential figures in technology and trans activism who admit this is the goal.  #transgender #conspiring #transhumanism]  \n",

Los Angeles, thousands of Catholic protesters demonstrated at the Dodger Stadium to express their discontent over the inclusion of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, self-described \"queer and trans nuns,\" in the team's Pride Night. Initially, backlash from Catholic groups and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio led the Dodgers to withdraw their invitation to the Sisters. However, the team later faced criticism from LGBTQ+ advocacy groups for this exclusion and subsequently reversed their decision, leading to continued controversy. The Dodgers' announcement of a \"Christian Faith and Family Day\" in July did little to placate the protesters, and Los Angeles Archbishop José Gomez dedicated a Mass for \"healing due to the harm caused\" by the Dodgers' decision to honor the Sisters. 💢 Thousands of Catholics have protested in opposition to the inclusion of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence at Dodgers Pride Night 🏳️‍🌈 The Dodgers hosted their annual LGBTQ+ Pride Night despite Catholic outrage 🏅 The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence received the Community Hero Award for promoting human rights, diversity, and spiritual enlightenment 🙏 LA Archbishop José Gomez dedicates a separate Mass for healing 🚫 The Dodgers temporarily withdrew their invitation for the Sisters due to pressure but reversed the decision later 🤝 Dodgers announce a “Christian Faith and Family Day” on July 30 🔈 The national anthem at the game was sung by David Archuleta, a former \"American Idol\" contestant, Should the Dodgers host the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence at its annual Pride Night?, The Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence have been re-invited to Dodgers' Pride Night. ]  \n",

sports? , VOTE: Do you support trans female athletes to compete in women’s and girls' sports?, Debate rages over whether transgender athletes have a performance advantage in sports, with some claiming there is not enough research to tell. Critics say the San Francisco Chronicle's statement that attacks on trans athletes are scientifically unfounded is ridiculous and that it flies in the face of established biological differences. A recent study confirms that there is a significant performance gap between males and females in various sports, a gap that can range from 10% to 50%. While some deem hormone suppression to be a solution, even this only minimally reduces the muscular advantages enjoyed by trans women. The inclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports undermines the fairness of competition, and society must strike a balance between inclusion and fair play. #sports - summary © am1.news - Read the original story and more like it on our website.

life, as one plucky middle-schooler demonstrated. At the April 13 School Committee Meeting for Middleboro, Mass. Public Schools, 7th grader Liam Morrison, a student at Nichols Middle School, stepped up to the microphone for two minutes of public comment — and then reached up to turn it down towards his mouth. He then narrated for the school committee what might be the silliest reason any student has ever been sent home from school: wearing a shirt conveying factually accurate information. “I never thought the shirt I wore to school on March 21 would lead me to speak with you today,” began the pint-sized culture warrior. He described how he was removed from his Tuesday gym class “to sit down with two adults for what turned out to be a very uncomfortable talk. I was told that people were complaining about the words on my shirt, that my shirt was making some students feel unsafe.” “What did my shirt say? Five simple words: ‘There are only two genders,’ Morrison emphasized. “Nothing harmful. Nothing threatening. Just a statement I believe to be a fact.” And not only a fact, but a bedrock principle to many lessons Morrison would likely have encountered in both biology class and grammar class. “Yes, words on a shirt made people feel ‘unsafe,’” repeated Morrison. If people did complain, they lacked the courage to tell Morrison to his face. In this instance, the accused was not accorded the right to face his accusers, making their very existence unverifiable. Morrison recalled, “Not one person, student, or staff, told me that they were bothered by what I was wearing. Actually, just the opposite. Several kids told me that they supported my actions and that they wanted one, too.” “I was told that I would need to remove my shirt before I could return to class,” Morrison continued. “When I nicely told them that I didn’t want to do that, they called my father. Thankfully, my dad supported my decisions [and] came to pick me up.” In other words, because Morrison’s shirt proclaimed a fact of biology and language that he learned (or should have learned) in school, school personnel sent him home — which would hinder his ability to learn — to quarantine his knowledge from other students. School personnel tried to justify their decision to Morrison, who said, “Their arguments were weak, in my opinion.” The Nichols Middle School dress code does not prohibit students from wearing clothing that displays a message — which is sometimes the case in a controversy of this nature — and school personnel did not object to Morrison’s shirt on that basis. Instead, they claimed that the shirt was disruptive and targeted a protected class. The dress code does provide: “Clothing that … inhibits learning is not allowed.” “Clothing must not state, imply, or depict hate speech or imagery that target groups based on race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, or any other classification.” “I was told that this shirt was a disruption to learning,” said Morrison. But “no one got up and stormed out of class. No one burst into tears. I’m sure I would have noticed if they had. I experience disruptions to my learning every day. Kids acting out in class are a disruption, yet nothing is done. Why do the rules apply to one yet not another?” A healthy measure of common sense lies underneath the crew cut. “I have been told that my shirt was ‘targeting a protected class,’” explained Morrison. But he had questions. “Who is this protected class? Are their feelings more important than my rights? I don’t complain when I see pride flags and diversity posters hung throughout the school. Do you know why? Because others have a right to their beliefs just as I do.” Here Morrison argues for the basic principle of free speech, that merely holding and stating a political opinion does not count as hate speech against anyone who disagrees. It’s not the dress code itself that Morrison spoke out against, but the illegitimate, arbitrary, and unequal way school personnel enforced it against him for his disfavored political views. Per the dress code policy, Morrison was asked to change. “If students wear something inappropriate to school, they will be asked to call their parent/guardian to request that more appropriate attire be brought to school.” Since he was unwilling, and his father supported his decision, he was sent home. Yet Morrison could face “disciplinary action” if he wears the shirt to school again. Even while they were enforcing the dress code policy against Morrison, the school officials seemed reluctant to admit what they were doing. “They told me that I wasn’t in trouble, but it sure felt like I was,” said Morrison. “I feel like these adults were telling me that it wasn’t okay for me to have an opposing view.” But (truncated), A middle school student in Massachusetts said he was sent home from school in March for wearing a shirt that said, \"There are only two genders.\", Twelve-year-old Liam Morrison was sent home from school for wearing a t-shirt that said \"There are only two genders.\"]  \n",

revoked due to gross professional irresponsibility. He has a history of aggressively promoting transgender ideology, and has encouraged many young people to engage in self-destructive treatments. Despite this, Benestad was awarded a professorship, and is known for calling himself “the world’s best” specialist in the field of gender-affirmative treatment. One of his victims, Alexander Linkowski, described his own experience with Benestad in a heart-breaking YouTube video entitled “My Detransition Story: The dark truth behind gender dysphoria and transition regret.” Benestad’s right to practice medicine has recently been restored, sparking concern for the welfare of future patients. #health - summary © am1.news - Read the original story and more like it on our website. We can only share about 20% of our full news feed on Facebook www.am1.news, Esben Benestad, a prominent physician in Norway, who also presented as Esther Pirelli, has lost his medical license due to gross professional irresponsibility. Benestad has been a nationwide celebrity and a pioneer in the field of gender dysphoria, known for prescribing puberty blockers to children as young as eleven after only a few chats on Skype and performing mastectomies on female-to-male patients under false pretenses. Benestad's actions and views were radically at odds with medical consensus, which previously diagnosed transgender people with a mental infirmity known as “gender identity disorder,” and has led to a period of reckoning for physicians, sexologists, psychologists, social workers, teachers, and parents who have pushed young people into transgender \"treatments.\" VG, Norway’s largest newspaper, recently exposed Benestad's whole reprehensible racket and sheer egomania. Although Benestad professed that his action against him would negatively affect his patients who “experience gender incongruence” and who otherwise have “nowhere to go,” he has done significant harm to an entire country's understanding of gender. The decision-makers in the Norwegian academy, media, and medical establishment who gave Benestad underserved power, influence, and attention are now seen in contempt. - © am1.news, Though the number of gender-affirming care providers in the Granite State is limited, a few New Hampshire mental health professionals have launched a coalition to help people find these resources. The Gender Diverse Care Coalition of New Hampshire offers free training opportunities, consultations with providers, resource sharing and advocacy work. Harvey Feldman, a licensed therapist based in Concord, is one of the coalition’s founders. He, along with New Hampshire-based therapists Deb Horton and Xavier Quinn, worked together to launch a website for the coalition in early 2022. “I don’t think that it’s a question of not enough providers by number,” he said. “It’s an issue of providers who, out of probably an abundance of too much caution, don’t feel comfortable working with gender-diverse folks.” For transgender people, receiving gender-affirming health care is a necessary step for both mental and physical wellness. Regardless of whether they seek transition-related care, transgender people need access to routine health care throughout their lives — just like anyone else. “There’s a real underlying belief here that [gender-affirming care] is elective, that it’s a choice people are making,” Feldman said. “This is not seen as health care, and I think that’s sort of a fundamental piece of trying to have a conversation here. If you don’t see it as health care, then none of the rest of the conversation makes sense.” You can read more about the coalition, in our first story from a solutions journalism series about gaps in gender-affirming care, by James Rinker:  Photos by Hannah Schroeder @schroeh. #transgender #healthcare #genderaffirmingcare #transhealth]  \n",

Read Now 👉👉👉 Traditionally, English pronouns have been associated with an individual's biological sex. However, a recent shift is underway, challenging this long-held belief. Advocates are pushing for pronouns to align with a person's self-identified gender rather than their assigned sex at birth. As of 2023, there are a total of 107 identified gender identities. One's happiness and self-acceptance should not depend on the approval of others but should be rooted in an authentic understanding of their identity in Christ. 👉To read the full story click the image below!👇 #Charismamedia #CharismaNews Vlad Savchuk Hungry Generation #peace #happiness #approval #Jesus, La Sierra University Church will hold the “I Am Affirmed” LGBT+ Graduation Ceremony on the Lord's Sabbath Adventist education is in the midst of monumental changes. On Sabbath, June 3, 2023, La Sierra University will be celebrating a special graduation ceremony “to honor lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, and ally students and to acknowledge their achievements and contributions to the university.” Even though the rest of the 2023 graduating class will not have their ceremony celebrated until Sunday, June 18, 2023, this Sabbath service is a special ceremony to recognize LGBT+ students. Paul Mallery, Chair of La Sierra University’s (LSU) Psychology Department, sent the following email along with an attached flyer advertising the “I Am Affirmed” LGBT+ graduation to all of LSU’s community: “The La Sierra University Church Kinship Sabbath School is organizing a Lavender Graduation Service for Class of 2023 graduates. Any graduating student from our local community who identifies as LGBT+ is welcome to participate. The date is June 3rd at 6:30pm at Sierra Vista Chapel. Students can RSVP at tinyurl.com/sdalavgrad23 (before May 12 preferred).” For Professor Mallery to send a “community” email to everyone on campus through LSU’s email server means that this “I Am Affirmed” LGBT+ graduation had to have approval from the university’s administration. In fact, the flyer states that this event will take place at the La Sierra University Church, a Seventh-day Adventist Church congregation. Adventist institutions are being targeted by a massive LGBT+ campaign, and La Sierra University is leading the way in LGBT+ affirmation. The message that was publicized to the entire LSU community is that the LGBT+ agenda is now being affirmed by school administrators. These initiatives aim to normalize the LGBT+ lifestyle among our youth. It is impossible to deny that there is a crisis of faith when we witness churches and other religious institutions openly supporting the LGBT+ agenda. The clear moral teachings of the church are being replaced. The modern church today spends its time accepting the radical gender theories of the LGBT+ movement rather than reaffirming the faith and the fundamental truths of God’s word. We would rather proclaim the LGBT+ gospel, climate change theories, and social justice instead of proclaiming the everlasting gospel of Jesus Christ that calls for repentance and conversion (Acts 3:19). #sda #adventist #adventista Click to read the full story: , ACNA BISHOP AFFIRMS TRADITIONAL VIEWS ON SEXUALITY. BLASTS NON-BINARY SELF DECLARATIONS Undergoing surgery, taking hormones, or non-binary self-declarations cannot change who God created you to be, said Bishop Julian Dobbs. Lines of demarcation have been drawn in our nation, he said. Archbishop Welby and his bishops are leading the church into apostasy. \"They are walking apart from Christ.\" The Church of England will cease to exist around 2060. The Bishop of the Anglican Diocese of the Living Word, The Rt. Rev. Julian Dobbs affirmed traditional views on human sexuality in a sermon to 300 delegates at the 10th ADLW Diocesan convention, held recently in Souderton, PA. \"Male and female he created them. Undergoing surgery, taking hormones, or non-binary self-declarations cannot change who God created you to be. The determination of your sex belongs not to you, your parents, your psychotherapist, your surgeon or anyone else. It belongs to God alone. God reserves for Himself the exclusive right to choose whether a person is male or female.\" \"We have men created in the image of God and we have women created in the image of God. Nothing else! There is no X -- unspecified or Y -- undisclosed, only male and female created in the image of God. Human beings, male and female, are God's masterpiece. Everything else that staggers our imagination and wows our heart and mind, everything else in creation that fills our eyes with astonishment, everything else is secondary to God's creation of male and female in his own image. You just can't read Genesis chapter one and be in any doubt about that!\" The bishop said the distinction is exceedingly relevant for our present day. \"We are living in a cultural moment in which there is increasing confusion about the significance of God's created order and about whether Christians should think about being male or female as something that is given and fixed, or as something that is to a substantial degree malleable and self-chosen.\" \"Being male or female is part of God's created design in His image. There are males and there are females and there is nothing else. Scientific research and discovery with its ability to look at DNA only confirms what we find in the Bible, male and female he created them.\" \"But bishop,\" you might say, \"You do not understand my situation, or that of my son or daughter, my nephew or my niece!\" I would say to you: when we believe the Bible to be the Word of God written, we give the Bible precedence to determine and interpret the details of our lives and if our life's experience contradicts the Bible, we must give the Bible interpretive authority. This is what it means to be a Bible believing follower of Christ. \"Many people today believe that human beings have all crawled their way through the primordial slime, up through the food chain to become homo sapiens and that we are just animals like other creatures that run around in the woods. And as a result, there is nothing special about our humanity; so if we want to identify as male, that is our choice and if we want to identity as female, that too, is our choice.\" \"The resulting chaos of this type of foolishness is on display across our nation. A profound deconstruction of our biological sex, which undermines the fundamental order established by God Himself, reflecting the very essence of who He is and who we were created to be, is taking place within every arena of society. When God's order is deconstructed and redefined, the consequences for sexuality, gender, marriage, family and society are profound. And when this deconstruction is aided by those who profess to follow Christ, it is a scandal.\" Read more: ]  \n",

'Monica.', In Andrea Pallaoro's knockout new indie \"Monica,' the radiant Trace Lysette ('Hustlers,' 'Transparent') plays the eponymous woman returning to her childhood home to visit her mother, Eugenia—the great Patricia Clarkson—who is severely ill. Monica originally left home as a teen because her mother wouldn't accept her trans identity, but Eugenia's condition has left her suffering from memory loss, which allows for an uneasy, one-sided reunion. With the fraught mother-daughter relationship at its core—and all the complicated emotions therein—'Monica' is a stunning film about compassion, care, and family. Coming at a time when anti-trans bills are being introduced across the country, when the conversation has once again turned to silencing LGBTQ+ voices under the guise of \"protecting the youth,\" Queerty spoke with Lysette and Clarkson about their film's message, particularly as it pertains to parents or adults who may have trans youth in their lives. In our conversation, the stars open up about the unique bond they fostered over years of working toward bringing this film together, and share what they hope audiences take away from this moving story. 'Monica' is now playing in select theaters nationwide. Video edited by Terence Krey.]  \n",

Hale killed three 9-year-old children and three adults with two semi-automatic rifles and a handgun before being shot and killed by responding police officers. With no motive known, some believe Hale’s writings will help to understand why she carried out the deadly shooting. Others say there should be less focus on the manifesto and more on gun reform, while some believe the writings could create a \"blueprint\" for copycats. #crime Authorities in Nashville are facing mounting pressure to release the unredacted manifesto of Covenant School shooter Audrey Elizabeth Hale. Calls for authorities to release what Hale left behind have grown in the weeks since the shootings. In April, Nashville police confirmed that they would release the manifesto recovered from the car of Hale, a 28-year-old transgender former student. The release, however, was delayed with the police department blaming pending litigation for the holdup. #crime - summary © am1.news - Read the original story and more like it on our website.

speak out against trans athletes competing in women's sports. In a tweet, Gaines asked tennis stars Serena and Venus Williams how they feel about males competing against women. Gaines became outspoken on preserving women's sports for biological females after tying for fifth with transgender swimmer Lia Thomas in the 200-meter NCAA championship last year. Gaines called on women and girls to boycott competing against trans athletes to raise awareness and ensure their sports are only for biological females. She stated that more athletes will first have to be robbed of titles for enough people to stand up and demand women's sports be reserved for biological females. Transgender athletes have proven successful in women’s sports, but Gaines believes allowing biological men into women’s sports \"doesn’t work.\" - summary © am1.news - Read the original story and more like it on our website.
