The Department of Justice just indicted Donald Trump over his mishandling of classified material. \\n\\nThis means Trump is more dangerous now than ever. He’ll repeatedly lash out at his enemies, exhort his followers, and lie continuously. \\n\\nHe’s already attacking me — all because I worked tirelessly to investigate him, impeach him and hold him accountable.\\n\\nTrump recently released his first TV ad of his presidential campaign – and within the very first second, he came after me.  \\n\\nWill you rush an emergency donation to our campaign to help us prepare for the attacks and lies we know are coming our way? \\n\\nThanks for your support. \\n\\n-Adam  \n",

Trump with criminal charges stemming from hush money payments he made to a porn star during the 2016 campaign.\\n\\nLet’s be absolutely clear: Donald Trump is as dangerous as ever trying to incite his followers to protest his arrest — we saw where his last efforts at incitement brought the country.\\n\\nThere is no doubt Trump will weaponize this indictment for his political advantage — just like he did with impeachment — because winning the presidency may well be the only way he hopes to avoid going to jail.\\n\\nIt won’t be long before Trump drags Adam’s name into this mess, so please, chip in any amount to our campaign today. Together, we will defeat Trump and his MAGA movement and protect our democracy.  \n",

$16 million just failed on a bipartisan vote. \\n\\nThis Kevin McCarthy backed vote shows how far MAGA extremists will go to exact revenge for Trump—and distract from his criminal indictment.\\n\\nBut make no mistake: This wasn’t the far-right’s first attack against me, and it sure as hell won’t be the last. \\n\\nIn fact, as I was walking off the Floor, Rep. Anna Paulina Luna—someone I’ve not met until today and couldn’t have picked out of a lineup—let me know that she’s filing another censure resolution next week, “and this one will pass.”\\n\\nUnfortunately for them, I will not stop my fight to put truth and our democracy first — 𝗜𝗳 𝘆𝗼𝘂’𝗿𝗲 𝘄𝗶𝘁𝗵 𝗺𝗲, 𝘄𝗶𝗹𝗹 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗰𝗵𝗶𝗽 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝘆 𝗰𝗮𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗶𝗴𝗻 𝘁𝗼𝗱𝗮𝘆 𝘁𝗼 𝗵𝗲𝗹𝗽 𝘂𝘀 𝗳𝗶𝗴𝗵𝘁 𝗯𝗮𝗰𝗸?  \n",

Republicans have made me their boogeyman because they’re afraid of oversight and accountability. They don’t want an outspoken defender of democracy in the Senate. \\n\\nNow that Trump has been indicted, these attacks are only going to get nastier. We have to prepare for everything they’re going to send our way. \\n\\nSo can you rush a donation of $3 dollars or more to help me fight back?  \n",

Manhattan District Attorney’s office has indicted Donald Trump for criminal offenses — the first-ever indictment of an American president. \\n\\nTrump will respond as he always does — playing the victim and blaming others for having the courage to investigate him in the first place. And you know that Adam Schiff will be at the top of Trump’s attack list.\\n\\nRush $10 or more to Adam’s campaign right now to help us prepare for Trump’s inevitable attacks — and ensure we defeat him and his MAGA movement in 2024.  \n",

Department of Justice just indicted Donald Trump on federal charges over his mishandling of classified material and his potential obstruction during their investigation. 🚨\\n\\nWe know he’ll weaponize this indictment for his political gain, just like he did for impeachment. \\n\\nHe will repeatedly lash out at his enemies, exhort his followers, and lie continuously. And he’s already attacking me.  \\n\\nWill you rush an emergency donation to our campaign to help us prepare for Trump’s inevitable attacks and lies?  \n",

Trump has been indicted on 38 federal criminal charges stemming from the hundreds of classified documents he intentionally took to Mar-a-Lago and refused to return in a conspiracy to cover it up.\\n\\nBut what happens next isn't up to just the Justice Department and our legal system. It also will play out in the court of public opinion.\\n\\nMAGA has launched a full-on assault on the truth and the fundamental democratic principle that no amount of wealth or power can put someone above the law. Trump, Republicans, and the right-wing media juggernaut have viciously attacked the Justice Department and baselessly labelled the indictment a \"witch hunt.\"\\n\\nIt's up to us to fight back in the court of public opinion—and for as long as it takes until Trump is held fully accountable for his crimes.\\n\\nTo help get the message out, we're giving away these \"Convict Trump\" stickers for FREE—while supplies last.

                                                          One famously thin-skinned ex-president. One Fox News host whose texts reveal a secret disdain for him. Three billboards that could set in motion a wedge between Donald Trump and Fox News.\\n\\nTucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.\\n\\nWant to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.\\n\\nThis is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and he’s been indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. \\n\\nAt this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.\\n\\nIf we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.\\n\\nSo let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a donor to MoveOn to support our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.\\n\\n[PAID FOR BY MOVEON.ORG POLITICAL ACTION, http://pol.moveon.org/.

indicted. 🚔 \\n\\nWe knew Trump was going to weaponize this indictment for his political advantage — just like he did with impeachment. \\n\\nAnd it’s clear this is only the beginning. \\n\\nWe know Adam will be at the top of Trump’s attack list 🙄, and we’ll need to fight back. \\n\\nCan we count on you to chip in today?  \n",

Now that Trump has been indicted, Trump and his MAGA loyalists are going to attack me more than ever. Can you chip $10 to help me prepare for these inevitable attacks?  \n",
              "649   “Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.” –Martin Luther King\\n \\n“Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.” –Martin Luther King\\n \\n“I have decided to stick to love…Hate is too great a burden to bear.”  --Martin Luther King\\n \\nOn April 4, 2023, Wisconsin chose love and light over darkness and hate and elected Janet Protasiewicz to change the balance of our Supreme Court, effectively ending a 12-year attack on our democracy that began with Republican governor Scott Walker in 2010.\\n \\nOn April 4th, 2023, Donald Trump was arrested, finally showing Americans that criminal darkness and hate are not above the law, even if you’ve been the president.\\n \\nOn April 4th, 1968, 55 years before the events of last week, Martin Luther King, who advised us to always choose love over hate, was assassinated.\\n \\nWhile I don’t ascribe to numerology or astrology, I’ve been thinking a lot about the significance of Martin Luther King’s words, his death, and how they relate to what happened last week. Similarly, I’m thinking about how all these events happened right before Easter, a time that coincides with themes of resurrection and new beginnings.\\n \\nThe last three years have been quite a journey, and I believe, like many, that this successful Supreme Court election marks a new beginning for me and the Minocqua Brewing Company.\\n \\nI began the journey of making #progressivebeer and raising money to support progressive politics in Wisconsin out of the crucible of grief, fear, and anger.\\n \\nMy wife had died from cancer in December 2018 and a little over a year later, Covid shut down my brewpub and I was forced to lay off my staff because Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell played political football with that second round of PPP money.\\n \\nI was angry, heartbroken, and scared at the same time. I hadn’t even figured out how to navigate life without my wife before I was faced with bankruptcy.\\n \\nSomehow I channeled all of that grief, fear, and anger into a righteous desire to punish Trump’s political sycophants in Wisconsin and poke the bright red Republican bear “Up North.” That anger burned hot inside of me for about three years—enough to keep fighting the good fight, but also enough to smother two relationships with really wonderful women.\\n \\nSomehow, after Janet was elected last Tuesday, much of that anger inside me melted away.\\n \\nAfter going to Janet P’s election night party in Milwaukee, I drove back to Minocqua the next day and once again pleaded my case to build a beer garden next to my restored Texaco gas station “tap room,” so our many customers could actually drink our beer on-site. While pleading my case, I saw five town board members stare at me with anger and hatred in their eyes as they voted “no” on my beer garden once again.\\n \\nOddly enough, I wasn’t angry. I don’t think I have much anger left in me. I think I may have used it all up over the last three years. “Hate is too great a burden to bear,” said MLK.\\n \\nI went cross country skiing the next day at Minocqua’s awesome Winter Park, one of the true winter gems of this little town. After getting 14 inches of snow last week, the trails were amazing, even in 35-degree sunny weather.\\n \\nI saw a dear friend and mentor of mine in the chalet and we decided to ski together. He’s a good Scandinavian-American Christian, which to me means his faith is deep but also somewhat irreverent and always practical.  As you might imagine, we get along swimmingly.\\n \\nHe reminded me that Martin Luther King was assassinated on the same day that Wisconsin elected a progressive judge and America arrested a cult-leading con man, and we spoke at length about what had transpired locally with my business.\\n \\n“Kirk,” he said, “I have never once doubted your intentions, and I admire them, but…let me say this as respectfully as possible… I’m not quite sure I always agreed with your approach.”\\n \\nMy friend, in his own delicate way, reminded me of the Martin Luther King quotes I pasted into the beginning of this post. \\n \\nAt some points, especially when it came to dealing with members of the Minocqua Town and Oneida County Boards, I let my internal darkness and anger get carried away and didn’t lead with light. My darkness didn’t drive out the unjust darkness of my local government—it just led to more darkness.\\n \\nI felt a need to publicly punish the Town of Minocqua for following Trump, ignoring Covid, refusing to enforce Governor Evers’ mask mandate, and obstructing me from running my business. And punish I did, for three years. It felt exhilarating throughout, but as most adults know, temper tantrums don't generally lead to successful outcomes.\\n \\nLast week, as I listened to Trump enumerate all the ways he’s been a victim over the last few years, and as I listened to failed conservative Supreme Court candidate Dan Kelly’s bitter non-concession speech focused on his own victimhood, I realized that this continued fight with my local government was turning me into these guys—a whiny victim.\\n\\nSo this Easter, I’m going to re-dedicate the Minocqua Brewing Company to leading with light and love instead of darkness and anger, and I’m going to be happy with the fact that there's a beautifully restored little gas station in Minocqua that serves as a tiny mecca for empathy, science, love, inclusion, and diversity.\\n \\nI’m going to attempt to reach members of the town and county board who I’ve publicly ridiculed and apologize to them—not because I was wrong to want equal treatment and due process—but because I came at them with anger and darkness as opposed to light and love.\\n\\nAnd above all, I hope that we can forgive each other and start fresh in the spirit of resurrection and new beginnings.\\n\\nAnd finally, I can’t wait for you to visit us when we re-open on May 12th for the summer tourism season. We're going to open with a BANG by releasing “Lady Justice, a Very Wise Weisse\"--our tribute to the four progressive women who now hold the balance of Wisconsin's Supreme Court.\\n\\nBe prepared to be a bit cramped every now and then—that space you drank in last summer, after which I was given a bunch of $400 citations for illegally allowing you to drink beer outside, is now going to be a parking lot.\\n \\nThe OBNOM WARS (Old Boys Network of Minocqua) are officially over. I’m waving the white flag. Life is too short, this town is too small, and summers \"Up North\" are meant for celebration, not protest:)\\n \\nAs for my political activism, I think I have one act left in me. The Minocqua Brewing Company Super PAC has raised over a million dollars to help get Governor Evers and Janet Protasiewicz elected, but there are a few things left to do—or “undo.”\\n \\nWith our new Supreme Court, I believe Attorney General Josh Kaul will successfully “undo” the draconian 1847 abortion ban in Wisconsin.\\n \\nI believe the progressive Law Firm named “Law Forward” will bring lawsuits that will end gerrymandering in Wisconsin and overturn a number of voter suppression laws that have been passed by Republicans over the years.\\n \\nThe one issue that I’d like to help solve is our broken public school funding system. I’m hoping to talk to some really smart lawyers over the next few weeks to determine if it’s possible to successfully sue the Republican legislature for siphoning money away from our public schools through private school vouchers and for creating an unequal public education system by refusing to update our state school financing formulas. \\n \\nIn tandem with that issue, I’d also like to see if it might be possible to legally overturn Act 10--Scott Walker’s bait and switch legislation that broke the back of the teacher’s union and drove so many wonderful teachers out of our state. If organizations reading this post are taking the lead on any of this, I’d like to offer the support and fundraising muscle of the Minocqua Brewing Company Super PAC.\\n \\nSo that’s the news from Lake Minocqua (no, not Lake Wobegon) on this Easter Sunday.  Here’s hoping we all remember to lead with light, love, and forgiveness...one beer at a time.\\n \\nKirk Bangstad\\nOwner, Minocqua Brewing Company\\nFounder, Minocqua Brewing Company Super PAC  \n",

Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and he’s been indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. \\n\\nAt this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.\\n\\nIf we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.\\n\\nSo let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago.

              "      <td>“Darkness cannot drive out darkness: only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate: only love can do that.” –Martin Luther King\\n \\n“Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.” –Martin Luther King\\n \\n“I have decided to stick to love…Hate is too great a burden to bear.”  --Martin Luther King\\n \\nOn April 4, 2023, Wisconsin chose love and light over darkness and hate and elected Janet Protasiewicz to change the balance of our Supreme Court, effectively ending a 12-year attack on our democracy that began with Republican governor Scott Walker in 2010.\\n \\nOn April 4th, 2023, Donald Trump was arrested, finally showing Americans that criminal darkness and hate are not above the law, even if you’ve been the president.\\n \\nOn April 4th, 1968, 55 years before the events of last week, Martin Luther King, who advised us to always choose love over hate, was assassinated.\\n \\nWhile I don’t ascribe to numerology or astrology, I’ve been thinking a lot about the significance of Martin Luther King’s words, his death, and how they relate to what happened last week. Similarly, I’m thinking about how all these events happened right before Easter, a time that coincides with themes of resurrection and new beginnings.\\n \\nThe last three years have been quite a journey, and I believe, like many, that this successful Supreme Court election marks a new beginning for me and the Minocqua Brewing Company.\\n \\nI began the journey of making #progressivebeer and raising money to support progressive politics in Wisconsin out of the crucible of grief, fear, and anger.\\n \\nMy wife had died from cancer in December 2018 and a little over a year later, Covid shut down my brewpub and I was forced to lay off my staff because Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell played political football with that second round of PPP money.\\n \\nI was angry, heartbroken, and scared at the same time. I hadn’t even figured out how to navigate life without my wife before I was faced with bankruptcy.\\n \\nSomehow I channeled all of that grief, fear, and anger into a righteous desire to punish Trump’s political sycophants in Wisconsin and poke the bright red Republican bear “Up North.” That anger burned hot inside of me for about three years—enough to keep fighting the good fight, but also enough to smother two relationships with really wonderful women.\\n \\nSomehow, after Janet was elected last Tuesday, much of that anger inside me melted away.\\n \\nAfter going to Janet P’s election night party in Milwaukee, I drove back to Minocqua the next day and once again pleaded my case to build a beer garden next to my restored Texaco gas station “tap room,” so our many customers could actually drink our beer on-site. While pleading my case, I saw five town board members stare at me with anger and hatred in their eyes as they voted “no” on my beer garden once again.\\n \\nOddly enough, I wasn’t angry. I don’t think I have much anger left in me. I think I may have used it all up over the last three years. “Hate is too great a burden to bear,” said MLK.\\n \\nI went cross country skiing the next day at Minocqua’s awesome Winter Park, one of the true winter gems of this little town. After getting 14 inches of snow last week, the trails were amazing, even in 35-degree sunny weather.\\n \\nI saw a dear friend and mentor of mine in the chalet and we decided to ski together. He’s a good Scandinavian-American Christian, which to me means his faith is deep but also somewhat irreverent and always practical.  As you might imagine, we get along swimmingly.\\n \\nHe reminded me that Martin Luther King was assassinated on the same day that Wisconsin elected a progressive judge and America arrested a cult-leading con man, and we spoke at length about what had transpired locally with my business.\\n \\n“Kirk,” he said, “I have never once doubted your intentions, and I admire them, but…let me say this as respectfully as possible… I’m not quite sure I always agreed with your approach.”\\n \\nMy friend, in his own delicate way, reminded me of the Martin Luther King quotes I pasted into the beginning of this post. \\n \\nAt some points, especially when it came to dealing with members of the Minocqua Town and Oneida County Boards, I let my internal darkness and anger get carried away and didn’t lead with light. My darkness didn’t drive out the unjust darkness of my local government—it just led to more darkness.\\n \\nI felt a need to publicly punish the Town of Minocqua for following Trump, ignoring Covid, refusing to enforce Governor Evers’ mask mandate, and obstructing me from running my business. And punish I did, for three years. It felt exhilarating throughout, but as most adults know, temper tantrums don't generally lead to successful outcomes.\\n \\nLast week, as I listened to Trump enumerate all the ways he’s been a victim over the last few years, and as I listened to failed conservative Supreme Court candidate Dan Kelly’s bitter non-concession speech focused on his own victimhood, I realized that this continued fight with my local government was turning me into these guys—a whiny victim.\\n\\nSo this Easter, I’m going to re-dedicate the Minocqua Brewing Company to leading with light and love instead of darkness and anger, and I’m going to be happy with the fact that there's a beautifully restored little gas station in Minocqua that serves as a tiny mecca for empathy, science, love, inclusion, and diversity.\\n \\nI’m going to attempt to reach members of the town and county board who I’ve publicly ridiculed and apologize to them—not because I was wrong to want equal treatment and due process—but because I came at them with anger and darkness as opposed to light and love.\\n\\nAnd above all, I hope that we can forgive each other and start fresh in the spirit of resurrection and new beginnings.\\n\\nAnd finally, I can’t wait for you to visit us when we re-open on May 12th for the summer tourism season. We're going to open with a BANG by releasing “Lady Justice, a Very Wise Weisse\"--our tribute to the four progressive women who now hold the balance of Wisconsin's Supreme Court.\\n\\nBe prepared to be a bit cramped every now and then—that space you drank in last summer, after which I was given a bunch of $400 citations for illegally allowing you to drink beer outside, is now going to be a parking lot.\\n \\nThe OBNOM WARS (Old Boys Network of Minocqua) are officially over. I’m waving the white flag. Life is too short, this town is too small, and summers \"Up North\" are meant for celebration, not protest:)\\n \\nAs for my political activism, I think I have one act left in me. The Minocqua Brewing Company Super PAC has raised over a million dollars to help get Governor Evers and Janet Protasiewicz elected, but there are a few things left to do—or “undo.”\\n \\nWith our new Supreme Court, I believe Attorney General Josh Kaul will successfully “undo” the draconian 1847 abortion ban in Wisconsin.\\n \\nI believe the progressive Law Firm named “Law Forward” will bring lawsuits that will end gerrymandering in Wisconsin and overturn a number of voter suppression laws that have been passed by Republicans over the years.\\n \\nThe one issue that I’d like to help solve is our broken public school funding system. I’m hoping to talk to some really smart lawyers over the next few weeks to determine if it’s possible to successfully sue the Republican legislature for siphoning money away from our public schools through private school vouchers and for creating an unequal public education system by refusing to update our state school financing formulas. \\n \\nIn tandem with that issue, I’d also like to see if it might be possible to legally overturn Act 10--Scott Walker’s bait and switch legislation that broke the back of the teacher’s union and drove so many wonderful teachers out of our state. If organizations reading this post are taking the lead on any of this, I’d like to offer the support and fundraising muscle of the Minocqua Brewing Company Super PAC.\\n \\nSo that’s the news from Lake Minocqua (no, not Lake Wobegon) on this Easter Sunday.  Here’s hoping we all remember to lead with light, love, and forgiveness...one beer at a time.\\n \\nKirk Bangstad\\nOwner, Minocqua Brewing Company\\nFounder, Minocqua Brewing Company Super PAC</td>\n",
