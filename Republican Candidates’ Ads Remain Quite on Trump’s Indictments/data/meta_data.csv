Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and it’s likely he’ll soon be indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen?

Trump Indicted by Grand Jury in Stormy Daniels Hush Money Case

Former President Donald Trump faces more than 30 counts related to business fraud in an indictment from a Manhattan grand jury. The Manhattan district attorney's office has been investigating Trump in connection with his alleged role in a hush money payment scheme and cover-up involving adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign. It marks the first time in US history that a current or former president will face criminal charges.

Trump is expected to appear in court Tuesday for his arraignment, multiple sources tell CNN.

Trump released a defiant statement, calling it ""Political Persecution and Election Interference at the highest level in history.""

The New York Times is reporting that President Trump has been indicted by a Manhattan grand jury, the sealed indictment will be released in the next few days and the surrender of President Trump to law enforcement in New York City is being worked out.

From Revolver News:  “For Trump, the Manhattan indictment is a badge of honor, as are any other indictments that follow in the days to come. Trump, more than any other politician, is the personification of having “skin in the game.” Trump could have very easily lived out the twilight of his life in unfathomable wealth, already a global celebrity and icon. Instead, Trump not only ran for president, he did so pursuing a transformative agenda that directly challenges most powerful and evil forces in the country. For Trump, this decision was financially ruinous and destructive to his reputation. Now, precisely because he refused to back down or submit to the pain box, his very personal freedom is in the balance.”",49.5,499

Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and it’s likely he’ll soon be indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a monthly donor to MoveOn to sustain our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.

Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and it’s likely he’ll soon be indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a monthly donor to MoveOn to sustain our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.

Obviously, Trump, like any other suspected offender, must be presumed innocent until proven guilty. True, this is the first time in the United States’ 246-year history that a president has been charged with crimes. While this is an aberration in this country, it has happened time and again in many other countries where heads of state have been charged with crimes, convicted, and served time in prison, including France, Italy, Argentina, Portugal, Romania, Japan, Pakistan, Turkey, and Israel, among others. Trump will face his day in court, he will be accorded legal protection and defense, and he will be treated fairly as required by law.

Trump’s indictment however also offers our country a time for reflection and healing. Whether or not Trump has committed the crimes for which he has been charged, Republicans are duty-bound to first allow the legal system to operate in the way it was intended to, and second not to float all manners of politically motivated and unsubstantiated claims that the former president is a victim of liberal conspiracies who are out to get him.

Over the past eight years, the country has gone through political turmoil unseen for generations. It is time to put the national interest above any one person’s or party’s political benefit. America has been a beacon of democracy and freedom, a novel experiment the world had never seen before. Every American patriot, regardless of political affiliation, must stop short of nothing to restore, protect, and defend the values, virtues, and valor on which America was founded.

Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and it’s likely he’ll soon be indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a monthly donor to MoveOn to sustain our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.

indicting a former president & the leading presidential candidate for the office of president is preposterous & unlawful.
When the indictment is completely made up & past the statute of limitations it is even more satanic & illegal.
Political gain & lust for power has overtaken justice & the law.
Where are the republicans who need to fight to protect this country from tyranny & downfall ?
The swamp creatures & the deep state participants have so much dirt on themselves & are so corrupt that they are scared of Trump becoming president again !
 It started with a phony Russian collusion & obstruction of justice, a phony special counsel investigation by Mueller & false information by Comey of the FBI.
It then followed by two witch hunt impeachments by Pelosi & her circus clowns. These acts had absolutely zero merit or justification, just pure harassment & hate of Trump.
Then with an extremely questionable election, with all election rules & laws being altered & modified, Biden , who could not gather a rally of 20 people miraculously won.
He won with the most votes in history !!!
They then create the January 6 hoax as an insurrection & as one of the worst events in the republic & a big danger to democracy !
Then the DOJ raids Mar A Lago under the pretext of securing ""classified documents"", documents that a president is allowed to declassify. Never mind that Biden as senator & vice president stole boxes & boxes of classified documents. Supposedly his upright lawyers found the classified boxes of documents & ""cooperated""with the DOJ !
The DOJ & the FBI under Biden have lost all credibility & respect.
the latest act of persecution is this shameful, political & fraudulent indictment by this hateful, unprofessional & inept DA.
They are out to bring down Trump, but with these partisan & corrupt methods they are destroying the republic.
If conservatives, moderate democrats & republicans & independents do not help stop this extremism & criminal conduct, there will no longer be a country worth saving.

~ by Hal Gershowitz

With the American political center essentially vacated or increasingly enfeebled, the political zealots among us see this as their moment. They are rushing the gates and pulling and pushing the guardrails that, for many years, made America unique among the nations, a place where a representative constitutional democracy worked, sometimes raucously, sometimes fitfully, but on balance, remarkably well.

Those days, for the time being, seem a distant memory. Today, power seekers abound for the sole purpose of consolidating power and satisfying the demands of those they believe can bestow it and attacking those they believe stand in their way. Special interests provide massive funding to those who will do their bidding. So, the zealots are having their day throughout the country.

It is absurd that assault rifles that can swiftly fire multiple rounds that essentially explode upon entering a child's body are readily available throughout the United States, even to teenagers who are not old enough to buy a six-pack of beer. That's why grade-school children, beginning in kindergarten, have to be drilled on what to do when there is a shooter in their school. And let's get serious; what can they really do? 

There were 930 active and non-active shooter incidents in our schools in the past decade, Non-active shooting incidents are those where a gun is fired, but no one is hit, or a gun is brandished but not fired. Last year alone, 300 such so-called active and non-active gun incidents occurred in our nation's K through 12 schools, including school shootings that resulted in 31 children being shot to death. A growing number of families are now, reportedly, home-schooling their children because they deem our K-12 schools too dangerous

Sadly, this gun mania isn't really tolerated because our elected officials, who could do something to reign in this absurdity, are strong second amendment people. The politicians simply fear the zealots at the gates will spend big bucks to defeat them if they embrace sensible gun regulation.

The notion that the gun conundrum is a second amendment issue is rather spurious, given that the founders formulated this constitutional amendment to protect the nation. One doesn't have to be a mystic to understand how the founders would feel about the zealots who tote around AR-15s, AK-47s, and high-capacity magazines. The founders would all turn over in their graves at the mockery our 21st-century gun zealots have made of their intent.

Zealots and Zygotes

And, of course, there is now a patch quilt of anti-abortion laws in various states in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to reverse Roe. This decision ended a half-century of law recognizing a woman's right to terminate an unintended pregnancy during the first trimester of gestation. One state, Oklahoma, makes abortion illegal from the moment of conception. In the Sooner State, a zygote, a single fertilized egg cell, is codified as an unborn child with rights that supersede those of an impregnated woman.

Zealots at the school door.

Classic books and depictions of classic art are banned today at the protest of even a single parent. Just this week in Tallahassee, Florida, a grade-school principal was forced to resign because he allowed a depiction of Michelangelo's David to be displayed in the school. His offense was that he referred to the world-famous sculpture as non-pornographic. One child's parents thought the nude was pornographic.

Zealots on the left take a back seat to no one when advancing their worldview, and, not surprisingly, tolerance of zealotry on the left has begun to wear thin. Even in Minneapolis, where left-wing zealotry soared following the brutal death of George Floyd, the people turned thumbs down on the leftist campaign to defund the police. In ultra-liberal San Francisco, the voters tossed out their ultra-liberal district attorney and then went on to toss out three left-wing zealots on the city school board. Almost immediately thereafter, merit-based admissions was reestablished at one of the city’s traditionally high-performing high schools. So even the nation’s most liberal city finally said enough is enough.

Zealots on the left and the right

The indictment by a New York grand jury this week of former President Donald Trump has, of course, dominated the news. While, as of this writing, no one knows precisely what comprises the 30+ charges against Trump in the New York indictment, a doctored payment to a former porn star is known to be the basis of the indictment. It also seems likely that this may be the first of several criminal charges forthcoming from ongoing federal and state investigations in Georgia, Florida, and Washington, D.C.

On the left, the commentary is focused on how much legal exposure the former President has. On the right, the commentary is focused on the fiction that the United States Justice Department has been weaponized against Donald Trump. It is impossible to separate the former President from the attempt to interfere with the peaceful transfer of power on January 6th, 2021, or the cache of classified documents that were spirited to his private residence in Mar-a-Lago, which he, apparently, falsely claimed he had previously returned to the U.S. Archives, or the attempt to pressure the Republican Secretary of State in Georgia to ""find the votes"" he needed to overturn the 2020 election results in that state. These are all serious offenses if they occurred, and the ""weapon"" the United States has to address these offenses against the nation is the United States Department of Justice.

The alleged offenses in Florida, Georgia, and Washington, D.C., if they result in indictments against the former President, will be adjudicated in courts presided over by competent judges, some of whom may have been appointed by former President Trump.

Former Senator Ben Sasse (R-NE) and now President of the University of Florida, summed up the country's zealotry dilemma in a Wall Street Journal opinion column earlier this year. ""…More than anything else, zealots—on the right and the left—seek total victory in the public square. They believe that the center of life is government power. They preach jeremiads of victimhood and decline. On the left, they want a powerful bureaucracy. On the right, they want a strongman.

Former President Donald Trump has been charged by a New York grand jury with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in an indictment that was unsealed Tuesday (4.4.23) after Trump was arraigned in a Manhattan courtroom. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges.

The Manhattan District Attorney's Office alleges Trump orchestrated a ""catch and kill"" scheme to suppress damaging information before the 2016 election. Prosecutors say the scheme involved falsifying business records to conceal three payments, including $130,000 that Trump attorney Michael Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels.

""The defendant DONALD J. TRUMP repeatedly and fraudulently falsified New York business records to conceal criminal conduct that hid damaging information from the voting public during the 2016 presidential election,"" according to a statement of facts released alongside the indictment.

While most Americans have been paying attention to President’s Trump indictment by the Manhattan DA, another story made the headlines in the conservative circles: the “meme trial” and the subsequent verdict of Douglas Mackey.  Last week, Mr. Mackey was found guilty of “conspiracy” in a Brooklyn New York courtroom for sharing an anti-Hillary meme.  The meme told Hillary voters that they should text their vote instead of showing up to the polls. Mackey now faces 10 years in a federal prison for tweeting out this meme.  

In January 2021, shortly after the January 6 incident inaugurated a national anti-MAGA crackdown, the Department of Justice charged Mackey with “conspiring … to deprive individuals of their constitutional right to vote.”
Mackey’s offense? Illegal memes.

Specifically, the DOJ claims that the meme created by Mackey merits a prison sentence of up to ten years, for violation of 18 U.S. Code § 241. The law, which concerns “Conspiracy against rights,” is a subset of the Enforcement Act of 1871, better known as the Ku Klux Klan Act.
The DOJ’s argument is that, by posting the anti-Hillary memes on Twitter in 2016, and designing it to resemble a Hillary Clinton ad, Mackey deceived the public into casting invalid text message votes, as part of a conspiracy to deprive them of the right to vote.
To be clear, the federal government can not show that this actually happened. But the government says that proving a dumb meme fooled a single person is NOT necessary to find one GUILTY of the dastardly crime of DISINFORMATION.",49.5,499

Today, the crooked District Attorney for the Manhattan District Alvin Bragg indicted President Donald J. Trump on thirty-four concocted charges. There was nothing new in the indictments. Federal officials had already refused to bring charges in any of the information used by Bragg. This is a political witch hunt–plain and simple.

 
Before DAY ONE in office, Bragg has had one mission. GET TRUMP. The reckless actions of a politically motivated district attorney should send a chill up the spine of every American. If this can happen to President Trump, it can happen to anyone. Democrats have weaponized our justice system. We must #SaveAmerica!

I STAND WITH PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP!",49.5,4499

Kangaroo courts & partisan activist leftist judges have taken control .
Indicting an innocent former patriot president with unworthy charges is shameful.
This politicization of the law will cost the country dearly. 
It is not about Trump or an individual but about the rule of law & justice. 
The country has become so divided & is so distracted from real matters of the nation that it can barely function anymore!
Broken borders , rampant inflation, high food & gas prices , disastrous foreign & domestic policies under one incompetent administration & the democrat party!
The democrats of today are everything but democratic ! 
The world is watching us & it’s embarrassing ! 
Our enemies are thrilled & our allies & friends are confused & perplexed.
Wokeism, gender identity, critical race theories, pronoun replacement & “global warming” & or “ climate change” , intolerance & hate & division rule the day.
Dragging a patriot former president to “ court” is a charade & a circus !
This by a corrupt DA who campaigned on going after Trump.
America & its once formidable institutions & values are taking a nosedive decline of formidable magnitude.
“ Make America Great Again” has been vilified & twisted to suit a warped narrative of the left with propaganda & misinformation & main stream news media advertising & complicity.
This has been nothing but a 7 year witch hunt & persecution of an enemy of the swamp & the deep state ! 
The statement that this indictment in Manhattan is the least worthy among other charges in other states by some lawyers & republicans shows how naive & clueless these people are !
All the charges past & present  from the Russian collusion & obstruction of justice & the quid pro quo impeachments & the “insurrection” & the “ classified documents “ made up scandal & the Mar A Lago raid  & “ tax evasion” & more are purely political persecution & have nothing to do with justice or truth. 
This “ nobody is above the law” leftist slogan really means that the former president is not equal within the law but inferior & below the equality that is supposed to be the law ! This self righteous fraud of a DA is so ideologically blinded & said he vigorously goes after “ white collar crime” while he lets violent criminals & anarchists free. Falsifying New York business records is his charge against Trump ! The man is a brainwashed, blind partisan fraud & gangster with the so called “law” on his side . 
It demonstrates pure injustice , harassment & persecution & intimidation of a very resilient & formidable man named Donald J. Trump.",49.5,2499

Bernstine Issues Statement Following Trump’s Arraignment
 
HARRISBURG – Rep. Aaron Bernstine (R-Lawrence/Butler) today released the following statement regarding former President Donald Trump's arraignment in New York City: 
 
“This is another example of liberal politicians weaponizing the government for political gain. When parents showed up at school board meetings to voice concerns about what their kids were being taught, they attacked and silenced them. When citizens challenged the oppressive restrictions during the pandemic, the left used the government to shame and shut them down. They have weaponized big tech to spread misinformation and silence the truth. Now, they are using the judicial system against President Trump because they can't win elections on their own. The left has lost touch with Americans, and instead of abandoning their losing, extreme agendas, they are using their power to censor citizens and chip away at our freedoms.”",49.5,2499

One of the first things you learn in law school is that a complaint (or indictment) must make a claim upon which relief can be granted/awarded, and here the prosecutor fails to even list the underlying crime, as if in Beria fashion he will come up with it at some point in the future. This complaint/indictment should be dismissed for failure to properly state a claim and Bragg should be disbarred for such an egregious abuse of his prosecutorial power.

This is not about guaranteeing one outcome or another. This is about due process, no matter your income, no matter how powerful you are. And the presence of this process demonstrates that we should have one law that applies to all people no matter who you are or where you come from. 

If there is evidence of a crime, and the grand jury moves forward with an indictment, then this is the process that must happen in our society. And there will be another jury of their peers to convict or acquit. I think people need to see these charges where there is evidence for it and I believe that the presence of that due process is what makes our system fair. It’s a consequence in and of itself. And I think it’s important.",49.5,499

Currently we have a 52-48 majority in the House of Delegates. We can’t afford to send another moderate to Richmond. This race has a real impact on the conservative agenda in Richmond. If you support the America First agenda: I am the candidate.  

➡️ Protecting Children: I believe in protecting the innocence of children. That is why I support legislation that would prohibit children from having sex changes under the age of 18.We need to keep biological boys out of girl’s bathrooms and locker rooms, and vice versa.  I will support legislation that would prohibit kids under the age of 18 from attending drag shows. I will will OPPOSE all mandatory COVID-19 vaccinations for children under the age of 18.  

➡️ Immigration:  I will support legislation that requires Sheriffs and police to work with ICE to go after illegal immigrants who bring drugs into our community.  Their drugs have caused an increase in the decline of our communities. Opioid addiction has devastated one too many families in our community. More and more Virginians are falling victim to addiction. Communities are on the decline as job loss and poverty further increase. I will  tackle the drug epidemic, reduce the drugs coming into our community, and help those devastated by addiction.

➡️ Pro-Life: We need to send Republicans to Richmond who will fight to end abortion. I believe  Life begins at conception.  I believe the lives of the unborn are protected by the 14th Amendment and our legislation should reflect that.  

➡️ Pro-Second Amendment: The Second Amendment is there to protect the people from the Government and for the defense of our Freedoms. I will NEVER support Red Flag Laws or Gun Control laws. 

➡️ Election Integrity: To ensure stronger and more secure Elections in Virginia we must  reinstate Voter ID laws, have  signature verification and scanned photo ID on absentee ballots, end mass mail-in voting, and have closed party primaries in the Commonwealth. Trust in our Electoral process is vital to the long term health of our Country.  

➡️ Farmers: Agriculture is Virginia's largest private industry.  We need to stand up with our family farmers in Virginia. In Richmond, I will support legislation that would prohibit the Chinese Communist Party from purchasing farmlands in Virginia. I support eliminating overregulation that affects the livelihood of our family farmers.

“Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.” –Martin Luther King
 
“I have decided to stick to love…Hate is too great a burden to bear.”  --Martin Luther King
 
On April 4, 2023, Wisconsin chose love and light over darkness and hate and elected Janet Protasiewicz to change the balance of our Supreme Court, effectively ending a 12-year attack on our democracy that began with Republican governor Scott Walker in 2010.
 
On April 4th, 2023, Donald Trump was arrested, finally showing Americans that criminal darkness and hate are not above the law, even if you’ve been the president.
 
On April 4th, 1968, 55 years before the events of last week, Martin Luther King, who advised us to always choose love over hate, was assassinated.
 
While I don’t ascribe to numerology or astrology, I’ve been thinking a lot about the significance of Martin Luther King’s words, his death, and how they relate to what happened last week. Similarly, I’m thinking about how all these events happened right before Easter, a time that coincides with themes of resurrection and new beginnings.
 
The last three years have been quite a journey, and I believe, like many, that this successful Supreme Court election marks a new beginning for me and the Minocqua Brewing Company.
 
I began the journey of making #progressivebeer and raising money to support progressive politics in Wisconsin out of the crucible of grief, fear, and anger.
 
My wife had died from cancer in December 2018 and a little over a year later, Covid shut down my brewpub and I was forced to lay off my staff because Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell played political football with that second round of PPP money.
 
I was angry, heartbroken, and scared at the same time. I hadn’t even figured out how to navigate life without my wife before I was faced with bankruptcy.
 
Somehow I channeled all of that grief, fear, and anger into a righteous desire to punish Trump’s political sycophants in Wisconsin and poke the bright red Republican bear “Up North.” That anger burned hot inside of me for about three years—enough to keep fighting the good fight, but also enough to smother two relationships with really wonderful women.
 
Somehow, after Janet was elected last Tuesday, much of that anger inside me melted away.
 
After going to Janet P’s election night party in Milwaukee, I drove back to Minocqua the next day and once again pleaded my case to build a beer garden next to my restored Texaco gas station “tap room,” so our many customers could actually drink our beer on-site. While pleading my case, I saw five town board members stare at me with anger and hatred in their eyes as they voted “no” on my beer garden once again.
 
Oddly enough, I wasn’t angry. I don’t think I have much anger left in me. I think I may have used it all up over the last three years. “Hate is too great a burden to bear,” said MLK.
 
I went cross country skiing the next day at Minocqua’s awesome Winter Park, one of the true winter gems of this little town. After getting 14 inches of snow last week, the trails were amazing, even in 35-degree sunny weather.
 
I saw a dear friend and mentor of mine in the chalet and we decided to ski together. He’s a good Scandinavian-American Christian, which to me means his faith is deep but also somewhat irreverent and always practical.  As you might imagine, we get along swimmingly.
 
He reminded me that Martin Luther King was assassinated on the same day that Wisconsin elected a progressive judge and America arrested a cult-leading con man, and we spoke at length about what had transpired locally with my business.
 
“Kirk,” he said, “I have never once doubted your intentions, and I admire them, but…let me say this as respectfully as possible… I’m not quite sure I always agreed with your approach.”
 
My friend, in his own delicate way, reminded me of the Martin Luther King quotes I pasted into the beginning of this post. 
 
At some points, especially when it came to dealing with members of the Minocqua Town and Oneida County Boards, I let my internal darkness and anger get carried away and didn’t lead with light. My darkness didn’t drive out the unjust darkness of my local government—it just led to more darkness.
 
I felt a need to publicly punish the Town of Minocqua for following Trump, ignoring Covid, refusing to enforce Governor Evers’ mask mandate, and obstructing me from running my business. And punish I did, for three years. It felt exhilarating throughout, but as most adults know, temper tantrums don't generally lead to successful outcomes.
 
Last week, as I listened to Trump enumerate all the ways he’s been a victim over the last few years, and as I listened to failed conservative Supreme Court candidate Dan Kelly’s bitter non-concession speech focused on his own victimhood, I realized that this continued fight with my local government was turning me into these guys—a whiny victim.

So this Easter, I’m going to re-dedicate the Minocqua Brewing Company to leading with light and love instead of darkness and anger, and I’m going to be happy with the fact that there's a beautifully restored little gas station in Minocqua that serves as a tiny mecca for empathy, science, love, inclusion, and diversity.
 
I’m going to attempt to reach members of the town and county board who I’ve publicly ridiculed and apologize to them—not because I was wrong to want equal treatment and due process—but because I came at them with anger and darkness as opposed to light and love.

And above all, I hope that we can forgive each other and start fresh in the spirit of resurrection and new beginnings.

And finally, I can’t wait for you to visit us when we re-open on May 12th for the summer tourism season. We're going to open with a BANG by releasing “Lady Justice, a Very Wise Weisse""--our tribute to the four progressive women who now hold the balance of Wisconsin's Supreme Court.

Be prepared to be a bit cramped every now and then—that space you drank in last summer, after which I was given a bunch of $400 citations for illegally allowing you to drink beer outside, is now going to be a parking lot.
 
The OBNOM WARS (Old Boys Network of Minocqua) are officially over. I’m waving the white flag. Life is too short, this town is too small, and summers ""Up North"" are meant for celebration, not protest:)
 
As for my political activism, I think I have one act left in me. The Minocqua Brewing Company Super PAC has raised over a million dollars to help get Governor Evers and Janet Protasiewicz elected, but there are a few things left to do—or “undo.”
 
With our new Supreme Court, I believe Attorney General Josh Kaul will successfully “undo” the draconian 1847 abortion ban in Wisconsin.
 
I believe the progressive Law Firm named “Law Forward” will bring lawsuits that will end gerrymandering in Wisconsin and overturn a number of voter suppression laws that have been passed by Republicans over the years.
 
The one issue that I’d like to help solve is our broken public school funding system. I’m hoping to talk to some really smart lawyers over the next few weeks to determine if it’s possible to successfully sue the Republican legislature for siphoning money away from our public schools through private school vouchers and for creating an unequal public education system by refusing to update our state school financing formulas. 
 
In tandem with that issue, I’d also like to see if it might be possible to legally overturn Act 10--Scott Walker’s bait and switch legislation that broke the back of the teacher’s union and drove so many wonderful teachers out of our state. If organizations reading this post are taking the lead on any of this, I’d like to offer the support and fundraising muscle of the Minocqua Brewing Company Super PAC.
 
So that’s the news from Lake Minocqua (no, not Lake Wobegon) on this Easter Sunday.  Here’s hoping we all remember to lead with light, love, and forgiveness...one beer at a time.

“Hatred paralyzes life; love releases it. Hatred confuses life; love harmonizes it. Hatred darkens life; love illuminates it.” –Martin Luther King
 
“I have decided to stick to love…Hate is too great a burden to bear.”  --Martin Luther King
 
On April 4, 2023, Wisconsin chose love and light over darkness and hate and elected Janet Protasiewicz to change the balance of our Supreme Court, effectively ending a 12-year attack on our democracy that began with Republican governor Scott Walker in 2010.
 
On April 4th, 2023, Donald Trump was arrested, finally showing Americans that criminal darkness and hate are not above the law, even if you’ve been the president.
 
On April 4th, 1968, 55 years before the events of last week, Martin Luther King, who advised us to always choose love over hate, was assassinated.
 
While I don’t ascribe to numerology or astrology, I’ve been thinking a lot about the significance of Martin Luther King’s words, his death, and how they relate to what happened last week. Similarly, I’m thinking about how all these events happened right before Easter, a time that coincides with themes of resurrection and new beginnings.
 
The last three years have been quite a journey, and I believe, like many, that this successful Supreme Court election marks a new beginning for me and the Minocqua Brewing Company.
 
I began the journey of making #progressivebeer and raising money to support progressive politics in Wisconsin out of the crucible of grief, fear, and anger.
 
My wife had died from cancer in December 2018 and a little over a year later, Covid shut down my brewpub and I was forced to lay off my staff because Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell played political football with that second round of PPP money.
 
I was angry, heartbroken, and scared at the same time. I hadn’t even figured out how to navigate life without my wife before I was faced with bankruptcy.
 
Somehow I channeled all of that grief, fear, and anger into a righteous desire to punish Trump’s political sycophants in Wisconsin and poke the bright red Republican bear “Up North.” That anger burned hot inside of me for about three years—enough to keep fighting the good fight, but also enough to smother two relationships with really wonderful women.
 
Somehow, after Janet was elected last Tuesday, much of that anger inside me melted away.
 
After going to Janet P’s election night party in Milwaukee, I drove back to Minocqua the next day and once again pleaded my case to build a beer garden next to my restored Texaco gas station “tap room,” so our many customers could actually drink our beer on-site.

I went cross country skiing the next day at Minocqua’s awesome Winter Park, one of the true winter gems of this little town. After getting 14 inches of snow last week, the trails were amazing, even in 35-degree sunny weather.
 
I saw a dear friend and mentor of mine in the chalet and we decided to ski together. He’s a good Scandinavian-American Christian, which to me means his faith is deep but also somewhat irreverent and always practical.  As you might imagine, we get along swimmingly.
 
He reminded me that Martin Luther King was assassinated on the same day that Wisconsin elected a progressive judge and America arrested a cult-leading con man, and we spoke at length about what had transpired locally with my business.

Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and it’s likely he’ll soon be indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a donor to MoveOn to sustain our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.

Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and it’s likely he’ll soon be indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a donor to MoveOn to sustain our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.

159107680118359,7292655492,MoveOn,left,MOVEON.ORG POLITICAL ACTION,2023-04-13,2023-04-13,,"One famously thin-skinned ex-president. One Fox News host whose texts reveal a secret disdain for him. Three billboards that could set in motion a wedge between Donald Trump and Fox News.

Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and it’s likely he’ll soon be indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a donor to MoveOn to sustain our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.

Former Trump Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe has called these leaks “catastrophic.”

There are many questions to ask regarding protocol, access, etc. which endanger our national security, and hence American and allied lives, but today we need to consider the punishment. In my view, if found guilty, he should receive maximum punishment, and the U.S. government should consider charging him with treason.

The U.S. Constitution defines treason as “levying war against [the United States], or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.” While lawyers are better suited to decide the chances of a successful prosecution for treason, there is no question that the leak gives aid and comfort to the enemies of the United States. If prosecutors decide that treason will not result in conviction, nonetheless, they should aim for the highest possible penalty—both because the leaker deserves it, and to make an example out of the leaker.

Then Donald Trump dedicated part of his CPAC speech to hurling insults at me. And Tucker Carlson went on a rant about me on his primetime Fox News show. And Matt Gaetz introduced legislation trying to bar me from accessing classified information.

Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and he’s been indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a monthly donor to MoveOn to sustain our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.

Tucker Carlson’s recently-released texts reveal his dislike of Trump—despite Tucker’s Trump-loving audience. And as Trump’s behavior from decades of petty squabbles shows, he holds a grudge. His fragile ego cannot stand embarrassment, especially not among the people who flock to Mar-a-Lago. So that’s exactly where MoveOn plans to put these billboards.

Want to see this happen? Of course! We all do. But billboards are expensive, which means MoveOn can put them up only if we quickly raise enough donations.

This is an opportune time to act. Trump is facing some massive challenges: He feels threatened by rival Ron DeSantis, and he’s been indicted under felony charges in Manhattan, potentially the first of a cascade of criminal and civil charges. 

At this challenging moment, Trump could use his Fox News propaganda machine more than ever. But Fox appears to be giving Trump the cold shoulder, and Tucker’s texts showing his disdain only deepen the rift.

If we can keep driving a wedge between Trump and Fox, it might deal a critical setback to Trump’s authoritarian dream of regaining the White House. This is an important opportunity in our ongoing commitment to make sure that does not happen ever again.

So let's help Trump and Tucker permanently part ways by making Fox's disdain for Trump visible to Trump's community in Mar-a-Lago. Will you chip in to make the billboards happen? And if you can, become a monthly donor to MoveOn to sustain our determined work making sure Trump never returns to the White House.

This year's theme was ""#SaveAmerica."" The evening started off with club president Gordon Campbell taking to the podium and thanking everybody for attending and supporting the Greenbrier County Republican Club. Then, Capt Bill Horn was asked to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

After the Pledge of Allegiance, Ron Kirk came to the floor to lead the club in singing our national anthem. Then, Club Chaplain Brentz Thompson was asked to lead the club in prayer before starting off the event. To kick things off, Gordon Campbell said, ""We were blessed to have so many elected officials with us tonight,"" and he was going to try and introduce some of them.

Some of the elected officials that were attending, as well as some of the candidates seeking office, included Chris Rose for US Senate - WV, Patrick Morrisey, Commissioner Lowell Rose, Greenbrier County, Tammy Greenbrier County Commission, Jeff Davis, Jamie Baker, Circuit Clerk of Greenbrier County, J.B. McCuskey, Chris Miller, Commissioner Kent Leonhardt, Senator Mike Stuart, Dan Greer, and Mac Warner for West Virginia Representative.

Club officials included President Gordon Campbell, VP Doug McKinney, VP Doug Beard, VP Judith Coughlin, Secretary Marie Lewis, Treasurer Allie Beard, and Club Chaplain Brentz Thompson.

One of the unannounced speakers of the evening happened to be Larry Pack, who is an advisor to West Virginia Governor and West Virginia's National Committee Representative. Larry Pack wanted to talk a little bit about the #RepublicanNationalCommittee and the work that they are currently doing.

As of right now, he noted that they have between 55 and 56 lawsuits nationwide regarding election integrity in 15 different states. Most of the lawsuits are currently in purple and blue states, and all they're trying to do is just get the states to follow their own laws.

He also talked a little bit about how they're getting ready for the 2024 Republican National Convention, which will be in Milwaukee, WI. He pointed out that we need to take back the majority in the US Senate, and there's no place to get to that 51 other than West Virginia. So, the amount of resources and advertising that's going to be coming into West Virginia is going to be enormous, and 2024 is going to be the year that we retire Joe Manchin.

So, after Larry Pack finished speaking, dinner was served. Dinner consisted of steak, chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, salad, rolls, and sweet tea. There was also a cash bar available.

At 7:30, Gordon Campbell decided to continue with the program for the evening. He announced a 50/50 raffle for those who wanted a chance. Afterwards, Gordon discussed a new award that is being introduced into the club. The award is called the Marianne Brewster Volunteer of the Year Award, presented by the Greenbrier County Republican Club.

The award itself is deserving and special, and one of the great legacies of the club is volunteerism, and it was presented to Faye Dunford. Chris Brewster, the son of Marianne Brewster, came up and spoke to the audience about the importance of volunteerism. He talked about his mother's legacy.

Chris Brewster talked about when his mother decided to run for Congress in 1988. She was a divorced woman and mother of two. She was in her kitchen and decided that she was going to run for Congress. Well, believe it or not, that wasn't popular. Nobody backed her, but she had a message and she had will. Generosity and volunteering were her main things, and that's what this award is about. Thank you, Faye Dunford.

The final scheduled speaker was West Virginia's Attorney General, Patrick Morrisey. He spoke for approximately 20 minutes before taking questions from the audience.

Morrisey began by stating that he wanted to discuss the challenges facing West Virginia in the years 2022 and 2023. The last decade has been particularly busy for the Attorney General's office, with issues such as the opioid epidemic, Medicaid fraud, and consumer fraud. Additionally, Morrisey mentioned his daily work of suing President Biden's administration, particularly as Washington attempts to impact West Virginia jobs.

As Attorney General, a significant part of Morrisey's job is to defend laws passed by the state legislature. Currently, the office is defending the most recent abortion law in court. Morrisey stressed the importance of defending the most innocent in society, stating that innocent babies deserve a voice.

He also spoke about how West Virginia is number one per capita in opioid settlements due to its litigation efforts. Fentanyl is a significant concern, as West Virginia has the highest number of fentanyl overdose-related deaths in the country. Morrisey emphasized the need to address this issue.

West Virginia is a state with much potential, according to Morrisey. The state is located within 10 hours of 180 million people and boasts natural beauty. He called for strong leadership in all offices to ensure that West Virginia makes the most of its opportunities.

Morrisey also spoke about the indictment of President Trump by a ""woke"" prosecutor, stating that this is not how the rule of law works in the country. He compared what is happening in Manhattan to what a Banana Republic would do, emphasizing that President Trump is being treated unfairly.

This year's theme was ""#SaveAmerica."" The evening started off with club president Gordon Campbell taking to the podium and thanking everybody for attending and supporting the Greenbrier County Republican Club. Then, Capt Bill Horn was asked to lead the Pledge of Allegiance.

After the Pledge of Allegiance, Ron Kirk came to the floor to lead the club in singing our national anthem. Then, Club Chaplain Brentz Thompson was asked to lead the club in prayer before starting off the event. To kick things off, Gordon Campbell said, ""We were blessed to have so many elected officials with us tonight,"" and he was going to try and introduce some of them.

Some of the elected officials that were attending, as well as some of the candidates seeking office, included Chris Rose for US Senate - WV, Patrick Morrisey, Commissioner Lowell Rose, Greenbrier County, Tammy Greenbrier County Commission, Jeff Davis, Jamie Baker, Circuit Clerk of Greenbrier County, J.B. McCuskey, Chris Miller, Commissioner Kent Leonhardt, Senator Mike Stuart, Dan Greer, and Mac Warner for West Virginia Representative.

Club officials included President Gordon Campbell, VP Doug McKinney, VP Doug Beard, VP Judith Coughlin, Secretary Marie Lewis, Treasurer Allie Beard, and Club Chaplain Brentz Thompson.

One of the unannounced speakers of the evening happened to be Larry Pack, who is an advisor to West Virginia Governor and West Virginia's National Committee Representative. Larry Pack wanted to talk a little bit about the #RepublicanNationalCommittee and the work that they are currently doing.

As of right now, he noted that they have between 55 and 56 lawsuits nationwide regarding election integrity in 15 different states. Most of the lawsuits are currently in purple and blue states, and all they're trying to do is just get the states to follow their own laws.

He also talked a little bit about how they're getting ready for the 2024 Republican National Convention, which will be in Milwaukee, WI. He pointed out that we need to take back the majority in the US Senate, and there's no place to get to that 51 other than West Virginia. So, the amount of resources and advertising that's going to be coming into West Virginia is going to be enormous, and 2024 is going to be the year that we retire Joe Manchin.

So, after Larry Pack finished speaking, dinner was served. Dinner consisted of steak, chicken, mashed potatoes, green beans, salad, rolls, and sweet tea. There was also a cash bar available.

At 7:30, Gordon Campbell decided to continue with the program for the evening. He announced a 50/50 raffle for those who wanted a chance. Afterwards, Gordon discussed a new award that is being introduced into the club. The award is called the Marianne Brewster Volunteer of the Year Award, presented by the Greenbrier County Republican Club.

The award itself is deserving and special, and one of the great legacies of the club is volunteerism, and it was presented to Faye Dunford. Chris Brewster, the son of Marianne Brewster, came up and spoke to the audience about the importance of volunteerism. He talked about his mother's legacy.

Chris Brewster talked about when his mother decided to run for Congress in 1988. She was a divorced woman and mother of two. She was in her kitchen and decided that she was going to run for Congress. Well, believe it or not, that wasn't popular. Nobody backed her, but she had a message and she had will. Generosity and volunteering were her main things, and that's what this award is about. Thank you, Faye Dunford.

The final scheduled speaker was West Virginia's Attorney General, Patrick Morrisey. He spoke for approximately 20 minutes before taking questions from the audience.

Morrisey began by stating that he wanted to discuss the challenges facing West Virginia in the years 2022 and 2023. The last decade has been particularly busy for the Attorney General's office, with issues such as the opioid epidemic, Medicaid fraud, and consumer fraud. Additionally, Morrisey mentioned his daily work of suing President Biden's administration, particularly as Washington attempts to impact West Virginia jobs.

As Attorney General, a significant part of Morrisey's job is to defend laws passed by the state legislature. Currently, the office is defending the most recent abortion law in court. Morrisey stressed the importance of defending the most innocent in society, stating that innocent babies deserve a voice.

He also spoke about how West Virginia is number one per capita in opioid settlements due to its litigation efforts. Fentanyl is a significant concern, as West Virginia has the highest number of fentanyl overdose-related deaths in the country. Morrisey emphasized the need to address this issue.

West Virginia is a state with much potential, according to Morrisey. The state is located within 10 hours of 180 million people and boasts natural beauty. He called for strong leadership in all offices to ensure that West Virginia makes the most of its opportunities.

Morrisey also spoke about the indictment of President Trump by a ""woke"" prosecutor, stating that this is not how the rule of law works in the country. He compared what is happening in Manhattan to what a Banana Republic would do, emphasizing that President Trump is being treated unfairly.

After taking questions from club members and the audience, Kent Leonhardt, West Virginia's Agriculture Commissioner, also responded to a question. The evening concluded with the 50/50 raffle and special thanks given to the dinner committee and its chairman, Doug McKinney.

Finally, Gordon Campbell said, ""If you like what we're selling, join the club. The Greenbrier County Republican Club is alive and well, and we are growing."" He encouraged everybody who likes what they're hearing and what they're seeing to join the club and be part of the team.

Special Counsel John Durham on May 15 released his final report on Crossfire Hurricane. Its conclusions are unambiguous. The report is dated May 12, so Durham has been at this for one day shy of four years. His investigation produced several indictments and one conviction of a former FBI attorney. Crossfire Hurricane was the FBI’s counterintelligence investigation into an alleged conspiracy between the 2016 Trump presidential campaign and the Russian government. Citing a not inconsiderable amount of evidence, the 300-plus-page Durham report concludes that the FBI threw its own rule book out of the window and charged into an investigation that would never have been opened had the Bureau lived up to its once-impressive reputation for competence and thoroughness. #DurhamReport

Yes, it most certainly is.
~by Hal Gershowitz

The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis was an extremely dangerous nuclear faceoff between the former Soviet Union and the United States. Those of us old enough to remember that high-tension, high-sea confrontation can recall the dread we felt as the world waited to see who would back off first. It could have easily turned into a deadly exchange of nuclear weapons, although the United States seriously outgunned the Soviet Union.

War was indeed possible but not likely. In 1962 the United States' nuclear arsenal was six times greater than that of the Soviet Union. The United States had over two hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching any target within the Soviet Union, compared to the Soviet Union's 36 ICBMs with warheads of considerably less destructive power.

The circumstances that produced that crisis sixty-one years ago and the circumstances driving the current crisis in Ukraine are remarkably different, making the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine far more dangerous.

First, to be clear, Ukraine's independence was recognized nearly thirty years ago when the Russian Federation, the United States, and Great Britain signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. The memorandum not only established the sovereignty of Ukraine's borders but expressly prohibited either the threat or the actual use of force, explicitly precluding the use of nuclear arms by any of the signatories. The prohibition against using nuclear arms is particularly significant because, in return for that assurance, Ukraine shipped all of its nuclear warheads to Russia for decommissioning.

Similarly, the differences between Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and (today's) Russian Federation President, Vladimir Putin, are important to understand. Khrushchev was, for many years, a loyal apparatchik who rose through the ranks into the privileged ruling nomenklatura. As the First Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers, he really wasn't a dictator who answered to no one. He was, of course, at the top of the Kremlin leadership, but that leadership plotted against him and, in a 1964 coup, replaced him with Leonid Brezhnev.

Volumes have been written about Khrushchev's fall from power and what precipitated his fall. The Cuban missile contretemps was, no doubt, a factor, but certainly not the only or primary factor. Significantly, there were those in positions of power who could effectively plot against him. There is no one in today's Russia to throw Vladimir Putin out of office; no one who would live to tell about it anyway.

Khrushchev was born late in the 19th century, a decade-and-a-half after Joseph Stalin. He worked closely with Stalin and rose in the communist party's hierarchy. Still, after ascending to leadership, he dared to become a vocal critic of his notorious predecessor, even denouncing him before the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party. Conversely, as the late Mikhail Gorbachev warned a dozen years ago, Vladimir Putin is ruthless and quite reminiscent of Stalin.

The Cuban Missile Crisis was somewhat of a tit-for-tat escalation in tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The year before the Cuban missile crisis, the United States had placed Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Turkey at the Soviet Union's doorstep. The Jupiter missiles were incapable of pinpoint accuracy, and it took several hours to prepare the liquid-fueled missiles for launch. Therefore, they were primarily considered first-strike nuclear weapons and were a huge thorn in Khrushchev's side.

Furthermore, the United States had flown approximately 30 high-altitude U2 spy planes over Russia for four years before the Cuban missile crisis until one was finally shot down in 1960. Our aggressiveness was, to Khrushchev, ample justification for attempting to checkmate us with Soviet missiles on our doorstep in Cuba.

The attendant drama and worldwide observation of our successful high-seas blockade of Cuba, and Secretary of State Dean Rusk's ill-advised comment that Russia ""blinked"" in the face of America's blockade had certainly tarnished Khrushchev's standing among the Russian inner circle by the time they ousted him two years later.

There is no functioning Presidium in Russia now. Putin is Russia, at least for the time being. For Putin, everything has gone wrong. He has shown himself to be an inept war planner and startlingly unaware of how inept his army is. He is today welcome almost nowhere. A warrant for his arrest for war crimes has been issued by the International Criminal Court, turning his ""special military operation"" into a nightmare that will follow him for the rest of his life.

The swift victory he presumed when he ordered Russian forces into Ukraine has become a humiliation in a country where humiliated leaders do not fare well.  

Thus far, in prosecuting his war against Ukraine, he has drafted conscripts mainly from the far eastern reaches of Russia and recruited criminals from the nation's prisons to keep the people close to major population centers such as Moscow and St. Petersburg unaware of how badly Putin's ""special military operation"" against Ukraine is going.          

Leaked U.S. intelligence reports estimate that nearly 50,000 Russian troops have been killed, and another 150,000 to 180,000 have been wounded. It seems a safe bet that Russia has been taking between 10,000 and 15,000 casualties a month since beginning its Ukrainian misadventure. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, there was one casualty. Major Rudolf Anderson, an American Air Force U-2 reconnaissance pilot, was shot down over Cuba.

The World Bank estimates it will cost close to a half-trillion dollars to rebuild Ukraine, assuming the war ends shortly, which does not seem likely. The bill for rebuilding Ukraine will, presumably, be sent to Russia. Everyone who expects Russia to pay that bill, raise your hand.

Meanwhile, NATO has finally gotten religion, and its members are substantially increasing their military budgets. Worse yet, from Russia's point of view, the treaty organization has now welcomed Finland into its ranks, and soon Sweden will follow—literally inconceivable before Putin's special military operation.

So, Putin's great misadventure has become one of the greatest military disasters in Russian history. And therein lies the danger. Putin can (1) either call it quits and retreat, (2) he can try to hold onto the Ukrainian territory he currently occupies and try to negotiate an end to the war, or (3) he can try to introduce ""a game changer"" into the conflict. He can begin using so-called low-yield tactical nuclear weapons as he has threatened to do.

Here's the rub. (1) If Putin calls it quits and retreats, he's done. His image as a master chess player on the world stage becomes laughable. (2) If he tries to negotiate an end to the war, the Ukrainians will be keenly aware of the worthlessness of their last negotiation with Russia that produced the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances, and finally (3) if he introduces nuclear weapons of any kind into the conflict, all bets are immediately off regarding restrictions against attacking Russian territory.

President Biden has rallied America and our European allies to provide the means to enable Ukraine to defend itself. History will treat him well for that. Seventy percent of Americans either support the country’s assistance to Ukraine (48%) or are neutral (22%), while 29%, mostly Republicans, voice opposition. According to Pew Research, most of the opposition is consistent with the growing share of Republicans who say the U.S. is providing too much support to Ukraine. Today, 40% of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents hold this view, up from 32% last fall and much higher than the mere 9% of Republicans who held this view a year ago. Why? Largely because former President Trump and his most avid supporters are loath to see President Biden get credit for anything, especially for supporting Ukraine after Trump could not bring himself to offer a word of support for providing the means to stand with the Ukrainian defenders of their homeland. When the former President claims the war would have never happened on his watch, he is really saying he wouldn’t have given Ukraine a dime once Russia invaded. I have little doubt but that he would have stood with the America Firsters 84 years ago as they fought against American aid to Britain in its darkest hour against the Nazis.

The Cuban Missile Crisis was dangerous, but it doesn't hold a candle to the danger Putin has visited upon the world. Vladimir Putin is a desperate man. He has demonstrated the greatest miscalculation since Hitler attacked Poland and Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojoidiki Tojo ordered the attack on Pearl Harbor. Desperate people are prone to do desperate things.

Yes, it most certainly is.
~by Hal Gershowitz

The 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis was an extremely dangerous nuclear faceoff between the former Soviet Union and the United States. Those of us old enough to remember that high-tension, high-sea confrontation can recall the dread we felt as the world waited to see who would back off first. It could have easily turned into a deadly exchange of nuclear weapons, although the United States seriously outgunned the Soviet Union.

War was indeed possible but not likely. In 1962 the United States' nuclear arsenal was six times greater than that of the Soviet Union. The United States had over two hundred intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) capable of reaching any target within the Soviet Union, compared to the Soviet Union's 36 ICBMs with warheads of considerably less destructive power.

The circumstances that produced that crisis sixty-one years ago and the circumstances driving the current crisis in Ukraine are remarkably different, making the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine far more dangerous.

First, to be clear, Ukraine's independence was recognized nearly thirty years ago when the Russian Federation, the United States, and Great Britain signed the 1994 Budapest Memorandum on Security Assurances. The memorandum not only established the sovereignty of Ukraine's borders but expressly prohibited either the threat or the actual use of force, explicitly precluding the use of nuclear arms by any of the signatories. The prohibition against using nuclear arms is particularly significant because, in return for that assurance, Ukraine shipped all of its nuclear warheads to Russia for decommissioning.

Similarly, the differences between Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev and (today's) Russian Federation President, Vladimir Putin, are important to understand. Khrushchev was, for many years, a loyal apparatchik who rose through the ranks into the privileged ruling nomenklatura. As the First Secretary of the Communist Party and Chairman of the Russian Council of Ministers, he really wasn't a dictator who answered to no one. He was, of course, at the top of the Kremlin leadership, but that leadership plotted against him and, in a 1964 coup, replaced him with Leonid Brezhnev.

Volumes have been written about Khrushchev's fall from power and what precipitated his fall. The Cuban missile contretemps was, no doubt, a factor, but certainly not the only or primary factor. Significantly, there were those in positions of power who could effectively plot against him. There is no one in today's Russia to throw Vladimir Putin out of office; no one who would live to tell about it anyway.

Khrushchev was born late in the 19th century, a decade-and-a-half after Joseph Stalin. He worked closely with Stalin and rose in the communist party's hierarchy. Still, after ascending to leadership, he dared to become a vocal critic of his notorious predecessor, even denouncing him before the Twentieth Congress of the Communist Party. Conversely, as the late Mikhail Gorbachev warned a dozen years ago, Vladimir Putin is ruthless and quite reminiscent of Stalin.

The Cuban Missile Crisis was somewhat of a tit-for-tat escalation in tensions between the United States and the Soviet Union. The year before the Cuban missile crisis, the United States had placed Jupiter intermediate-range ballistic missiles in Turkey at the Soviet Union's doorstep. The Jupiter missiles were incapable of pinpoint accuracy, and it took several hours to prepare the liquid-fueled missiles for launch. Therefore, they were primarily considered first-strike nuclear weapons and were a huge thorn in Khrushchev's side.

Furthermore, the United States had flown approximately 30 high-altitude U2 spy planes over Russia for four years before the Cuban missile crisis until one was finally shot down in 1960. Our aggressiveness was, to Khrushchev, ample justification for attempting to checkmate us with Soviet missiles on our doorstep in Cuba.

The attendant drama and worldwide observation of our successful high-seas blockade of Cuba, and Secretary of State Dean Rusk's ill-advised comment that Russia ""blinked"" in the face of America's blockade had certainly tarnished Khrushchev's standing among the Russian inner circle by the time they ousted him two years later.

There is no functioning Presidium in Russia now. Putin is Russia, at least for the time being. For Putin, everything has gone wrong. He has shown himself to be an inept war planner and startlingly unaware of how inept his army is. He is today welcome almost nowhere. A warrant for his arrest for war crimes has been issued by the International Criminal Court, turning his ""special military operation"" into a nightmare that will follow him for the rest of his life.

The swift victory he presumed when he ordered Russian forces into Ukraine has become a humiliation in a country where humiliated leaders do not fare well.

It seems a safe bet that Russia has been taking between 10,000 and 15,000 casualties a month since beginning its Ukrainian misadventure. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, there was one casualty.

The World Bank estimates it will cost close to a half-trillion dollars to rebuild Ukraine, assuming the war ends shortly, which does not seem likely. The bill for rebuilding Ukraine will, presumably, be sent to Russia. Everyone who expects Russia to pay that bill, raise your hand.

Meanwhile, NATO has finally gotten religion, and its members are substantially increasing their military budgets. Worse yet, from Russia's point of view, the treaty organization has now welcomed Finland into its ranks, and soon Sweden will follow—literally inconceivable before Putin's special military operation.

So, Putin's great misadventure has become one of the greatest military disasters in Russian history. And therein lies the danger. Putin can (1) either call it quits and retreat, (2) he can try to hold onto the Ukrainian territory he currently occupies and try to negotiate an end to the war, or (3) he can try to introduce ""a game changer"" into the conflict.

It's a shame to see our beautiful country turn gradually into a banana republic. For the radical left to weaponize the DOJ and other state agencies against half of the country is disgusting and we have to stop it. 

However, what we must understand is that to combat these practices, we must first regain and wield political power to stop these miscarriages of justice. 

To do this means we must win back the White House in 2024, and the road to a Republican White House runs right through the heart of Georgia. We've seen how extremely important Georgia is to national politics the past few election cycles, and we can't allow the radical democrats to win once again in 2024. 

Luckily, we hold our destiny in our own hands. To ensure we defeat the radical left here in Georgia in 2024, we first need to get the GAGOP back on track and make it relevant and powerful once again. The first step to that is to elect Chairman Dennis Futch the next GAGOP Chairman this Saturday, June 10 at the State Convention.

Biden corruption was undeniable , to the point of bribery & treason.
They no longer try to act within reason or restraint, they do it in as they say ""in broad daylight"" & openly. They have the shameless news media & operatives & activists to spin the truth.
They blatantly lie to the American people without concern or remorse. 
The fact that crooked Biden had classified documents all over his places since he was a Senator & Vice President has no consequence for Biden nor does the DOJ care about the illegality of Biden doing so.
This is no longer the America where "" No one is above the law"" ! This has become a tyranny of government against innocent citizens including J6 victims & sane minded parents & conservative minds.
To indict the leading candidate of the opposition party at such a crucial time is absolute anarchy & unjust. An ex President at that !!!!! 
The democrats who lead these illegal, partisan actions are acting above the law while falsely chanting "" no one is above the law"" 
They are masters of deceit & dirty politics & fraud. Among other reasons they do not want Trump to become President is that he will expose all the corruption and all the ""Deep State"" characters & their treason & fraud against the American people.

A federal indictment unsealed Friday charges former President Donald Trump with 37 felony counts stemming from an investigation into the presence of a trove of classified information at his Florida estate and other locations after he left office.

Prosecutors led by Special Counsel Jack Smith allege that Trump arranged to remove a massive collection of highly sensitive classified material — much of which consists of intelligence about the “defense and weapons capabilities” of the United States and foreign countries — to his private residence as he left the White House in January 2021.

He had aides stash those records in boxes that also included personal items and ordered them shipped to his estate in Mar-a-Lago at the end of his tenure, according to the indictment. The 49-page charging document also says that on at least two occasions, Trump showed classified records to visitors without security clearances at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey — including the map of a military operation to a representative of his political committee.

As the Justice Department began inquiring about the records stashed at Trump’s home, the indictment alleges, Trump ordered an aide — Walt Nauta — to begin moving boxes with classified records to obscure them from investigators. Trump did this without informing his attorney, who was preparing to search Trump’s property in compliance with court-authorized subpoenas to recover the records.

Trump is facing 31 counts of violating the Espionage Act through “willful retention” of classified records, plus six counts — including obstruction of justice and false statements — stemming from his alleged efforts to impede the investigation. Nauta was also charged with six felonies related to the alleged cover-up.

“We have one set of laws in this country,” said Smith, briefly addressing the media after the unsealing of the indictment. “They apply to everyone.”

President Joe Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland have indicted former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in 2024 in an unprecedented abuse of power. The Trump indictment represents a threat to constitutional governance. We are in a battle over whether the Constitution and Declaration of Independence even matter anymore, and it is incumbent upon the House to exercise its Article I responsibility to rein in an out of control executive and begin impeachment proceedings against both Biden and his Attorney General immediately. The indictment came on the same day major allegations related to President Joe Biden’s taking a $5 million bribe in exchange for getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired hit American news outlets. After this bombshell, very credible allegation of bribery, the Justice Department leaped into action and indicted former President Donald Trump for having classified documents that any reasonable reading of the law and Constitution indicates he had every right to have because they were declassified. Joe Biden over the past four years has repeatedly stated that his presidency is about the soul of the country. If what’s happened on June 8, 2023, with this massive abuse of power for a sitting president to imprison his political opponent doesn’t convince you that our nation’s soul is at stake, nothing will.

Former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty in Miami Tuesday to 37 felony counts related to his alleged mishandling of classified documents. The first 3 charges are shown in the pic below.

The indictment lists the following felony counts: 

• 31 counts of willful retention of classified documents
• 1 count of conspiracy to obstruct justice
• 1 count of withholding a document or record
• 1 count of corruptly concealing a document or record
• 1 count of concealing a document in a federal investigation
• 1 count of scheme to conceal
• 1 count of making false statements and representations.

Quote from the indictment:
Trump stored in his boxes included information regarding defense and weapons capabilities of both the United States and foreign countries; United States nuclear programs; potential vulnerabilities of the United States and its allies to military attack; and plans for possible retaliation in response to a foreign attack. The unauthorized disclosure of these classified documents could put at risk the national security of the United States, foreign relations, the safety of the United States military, and human sources and the continued viability of sensitive intelligence collection methods.

The Biden-appointed Special Counsel has INDICTED me in yet another witch hunt regarding documents that I had the RIGHT to declassify as President of the United States.

This is nothing but a disgusting act of Election Interference by the ruling party to ELIMINATE its opposition and amass total control over our country.

But let me make one thing perfectly clear: No matter how viciously they attack me, I will NEVER, EVER SURRENDER our country to the radical Left – and I will NEVER end this presidential campaign that puts YOU first.

With YOUR support, we will once again surge even higher and prove that NOTHING can stop the American people from taking back control of our country.

Please watch my response and then contribute to peacefully stand with me today and prove that YOU will NEVER surrender our country to the radical Left.",49.5,499

But you are in good company with Anderson Cooper the insolent James Acosta & most of the other propagandist news people in your fake news circus ! 
Donald Trump had every right to go to a restaurant after the stupid indictment & arraignment of today ! Yes,  many people were there  to greet him & cheer him on after the charade of the charges. 
Shame on you because it’s so obvious that you & your entire network of spies work for the democrat party & you are paid & bought for ! 
The vast majority of Americans know the truth about the Biden administration & his fascist DOJ & the injustice being thrown on Trump by the weaponized government gone loose & wild !
Biden had documents in his possession since being a Senator & Vice President, which he stole illegally! Totally criminal ! 
The Presidential Records Act totally absolves President Trumps of any wrong doing !
Any objective observer has witnessed the incessant attacks on Trump since he announced he was running for President since 2016 coming down the escalators 
All the hoaxes & lies against Trump have been proven manufactured by shameless political opponents like Hillarry, Obama, Biden, Blinken, the DOJ & the FBI & numerous other intelligence officers like Brennan & Clapper !
Shame on you MSM & your fraudulent efforts to misinform the people!
Go after the bribery of Biden & his treason 
against the country ! Go after Biden for peddling influence & being corrupt to the core ! That’s the real crime against the nation.
Stop the 7 year harassment of an innocent man you’ve tried to harass & destroy from day one for being a patriot! Stop the political persecution of your major political opponent who is winning in all polls & who you already cheated once ! 
You, CNN & the other “News organizations” have helped the fascist government & the democrats charge Trump of all the crimes that Hillary & Biden really committed. Pelosi tried to impeach Trump for the “quid pro quo“ he never committed but was clearly proven to have been done by Biden with Ukraine.

I’ve taken on the toughest fights, stood up to a twice-impeached, twice indicted, ex-president, and defended our democracy. Now, Trump’s supporters are exacting political revenge by trying to intimidate and silence me—because they fear that I am too effective.

~by Hal Gershowitz

The once formidable Whig Party swiftly disintegrated in 1854, giving rise to the Republican Party of Abraham Lincoln, of which only a tiny and declining remnant still remains. 

Many prominent Whigs of the 19th century understood the historical moment in which they found themselves. That historical moment was the odious continuation of slavery in America. Still, they were not up to the task of altering the Party's indifference and, therefore, the Party's rapid slide toward oblivion. Today's Republican Party, now in its 169th year, is faced with an equally decisive moment and appears to be as paralyzed by the lack of strong and principled leadership as were the Whigs of the 19th century when the better angels of their nature were too few and too silent.

Now, to be sure, there are vast differences between the circumstances and issues we face today and those of the mid-nineteenth century. Slavery was the overriding issue then. Half the country's economy depended mainly on the bondage of human beings, and that very reality repulsed the other half of the country.

This week, a new historical reality is facing the nation, and the Republican Party in particular. The United States Department of Justice has unveiled an exceedingly serious 37-count criminal indictment against former Republican President Donald Trump. This criminal indictment will rivet the nation's attention and turbocharge American political tension as have few other moments in the nation's history.

Already the Republican Party has charged the government with weaponizing the Justice Department against the former President. To many Americans, it is the Republican caucus in Congress that has been weaponized against law and order and the Constitution of the United States, which they have sworn an oath to defend and support.

The Republican Party has every right to demand that the nation consider former President Trump innocent until proven otherwise. Every citizen should recognize where the burden of proof resides, that is, with the government.

According to press reports, former President Trump has terminated his current legal team and brought in new legal counsel to defend him. We may never know whether the former President fired his attorneys or whether his attorneys resigned because of their inability to influence, let alone manage, Trump's vitriolic outbursts. Meanwhile, the Republican Party has decided to declare the former President a victim of a government vendetta, even before the government has had an opportunity to present its case of serious criminal misconduct.

According to the indictment, former President Trump not only purloined extremely sensitive top-secret files, but the indictment also charges that he pressured his lawyers not to turn over the documents the government sought and went so far as to instruct them to say he did not have the documents they knew he had, and, even to ""hide or destroy the documents” if necessary.

The Republican Party has thrown caution to the wind with its unbridled support of the former President. The Republican leadership seems to assume that there is such a broad panoply of issues roiling the nation that they can deflect from the public consciousness the seriousness of the offenses with which the former President has been charged.  

Today, unlike the mid-19th century, during which the reality of slavery was the defining political issue of the time, Republicans seem to be counting on the fact that vast portions of the population are distracted by a myriad of other issues such as inflation, the cost of medical care, the viability of Social Security, climate change, veterans' affairs, federal income taxes, and on and on.

We're not the one-issue nation we were 169 years ago when the institution of slavery overrode all other issues, especially as the country continued to expand westward. So, most historians have, until now, correctly waved off comparisons between the Whigs of the 19th century and the Republicans of the 21st century. Conventional wisdom has held that too many issues are important to too many people for any one issue today to have the impact that slavery had in the middle of the 19th century.

Other than war, it has been rare for one issue to dominate the nation's thinking as slavery did in the 19th century, sufficient to jeopardize a political party's survival. Today, however, we may be at such a moment. The 37-count criminal indictment against former President Trump, along with other possible criminal indictments being considered relative to the attempted coup on January 6th, 2021, may represent the greatest national trauma since that which presaged the Whig’s decent into oblivion.

We are at the center of a controversy like no other in our history, and the leader of the Republican Party, former President Donald Trump, is at the center of that controversy. A week ago, Pulitzer-Prize-winning Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan wrote, ""If Trump Republicans propel Donald Trump over the top in the primaries, they will be doing and will have done two things. They will have made him their nominee for the presidency, and they will have ended the Republican Party. I don't mean this rhetorically, in the way of people walking around the past eight years crying, ""The party as I knew it is gone."" I mean it literally: The GOP will disappear as a party. Meaning the primary national vehicle of conservative thought and policy will disappear.""

Now, former President Trump and columnist Peggy Noonan are certainly not fans of one another. He wrote of her only a year ago, ""I listen to all of these foolish (stupid!) people, often living in a bygone era, like the weak and frail RINO, Peggy Noonan.""

 Since then, things have only gotten worse for the Republican Party. A Grand Jury in Washington, D.C., is apparently deciding whether to issue yet another indictment of the former President for inciting, if not planning, the attempted coup on January 6th, 2021.

Few events in American history have riveted the people's attention, as have the legal travails, both civil and criminal, of former President Donald Trump. The Republican Party has been steadfast in its support of the former President, notwithstanding those civil and criminal charges that have been brought against him or those already adjudicated.

Jack Smith, the Special Counsel appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland to investigate whether or not former President Trump knowingly acted illegally concerning the Mar-a-Lago documents case and the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6th, 2021, has successfully prosecuted both Democrats and Republicans for corruption, as well as war criminals at the International Criminal Court in the Hauge.

While former President Trump has called Special Counsel Smith ""a deranged lunatic,"" former Trump-appointed Attorney General Bill Barr thinks otherwise. Barr said he thinks the public will eventually realize the former President's culpability. ""Over time, people will see that this is not a case of the Department of Justice conducting a witch hunt,"" Barr said during an interview on CBS last week. ""In fact, they approached this very delicately and with deference to the President, and this would have gone nowhere had the President just returned the documents. But he jerked them around for a year and a half.""

With the possibility of more criminal indictments to come, the nation in general, and the Republican Party in particular, will, in the weeks and months ahead, write an immensely important chapter in the history of our country. We are in a time like no other since 1854 when the Republican Party was born out of the Whig Party's failings during another time of crisis in America.

Today's Republicans should carefully study that period of American history.

The indictment of former President Donald Trump, the Republican frontrunner in 2024, is in an unprecedented abuse of power, and it is incumbent upon the House to exercise its Article I responsibility to rein in an out of control executive and begin impeachment proceedings against both President Joe Biden and his Attorney General Merrick Garland immediately. The indictment came on the same day major allegations related to President Joe Biden’s taking a $5 million bribe in exchange for getting a Ukrainian prosecutor fired hit American news outlets. After this bombshell, very credible allegation of bribery, the Justice Department leaped into action and indicted former President Donald Trump for having classified documents that any reasonable reading of the law and Constitution indicates he had every right to have because they were declassified. Joe Biden over the past four years has repeatedly stated that his presidency is about the soul of the country. If what’s happened on June 8, 2023, with this massive abuse of power for a sitting president to imprison his political opponent doesn’t convince you that our nation’s soul is at stake, nothing will. The House must commence impeachment proceedings immediately, and the Senate should prepare for a trial to convict Biden!
